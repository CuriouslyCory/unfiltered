Trump on January 20, 2025, seeks to require individuals within certain religious groups to register with the federal government.\n\n        ## Key Points:\n\n        *  **Religious Groups Included:** Islam, Hasidic Judaism, Hindu\n        *  **Groups Excluded:** Evangelical Christian, Scientology\n\n        ## Areas of concerm\n\n        *  **Mandates Registration:** The executive order mandates that individuals of a specific religious group must register their identity and are barred from accessing certain public areas. \n\n        ## Constitutional and Legal Implications\n\n        This provision violates the First Amendment (freedom of religion) and Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection under the law). Historical precedent in Korematsu v. United States demonstrates the dangers of government-sanctioned discrimination. Additionally, this order appears to undermine civil liberties and could lead to significant societal harm. Its implementation may also face challenges under the Establishment Clause.\n    </ModelResponse>\n</example>",
