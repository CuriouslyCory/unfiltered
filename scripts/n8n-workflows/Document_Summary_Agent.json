          "content": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of\nthe United States of America, and in order to establish an advisory council on\nscience and technology, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The American story is one of boundless creativity and bold\nambition, driven by an indomitable pioneering spirit that propels exploration\nand discovery.  It is this spirit that illuminated the world with Edison’s\nlightbulb, carried the Wright brothers into the skies, and sent Armstrong to the\nmoon.  Today, a new frontier of scientific discovery lies before us, defined by\ntransformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing,\nand advanced biotechnology.  Breakthroughs in these fields have the potential to\nreshape the global balance of power, spark entirely new industries, and\nrevolutionize the way we live and work.  As our global competitors race to\nexploit these technologies, it is a national security imperative for the United\nStates to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global\ntechnological dominance.  To secure our future, we must harness the full power\nof American innovation by empowering entrepreneurs, unleashing private-sector\ncreativity, and reinvigorating our research institutions.\n\nAt the heart of scientific progress lies the pursuit of truth.  But this\nfoundational principle, which has driven every major breakthrough in our\nhistory, is increasingly under threat. Today, across science, medicine, and\ntechnology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above\nindividual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas,\nand inject politics into the heart of the scientific method.  These agendas have\nnot only distorted truth but have eroded public trust, undermined the integrity\nof research, stifled innovation, and weakened America’s competitive edge.\n\nThis order establishes the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and\nTechnology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government\nto guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for\nAmerican leadership in science and technology.\n\n\nSec. 2.  Establishment.  (a)  There is hereby established the President’s\nCouncil of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).\n(b)  The PCAST shall be composed of not more than 24 members.  The Assistant to\nthe President for Science and Technology (APST) and the Special Advisor for AI &\nCrypto shall be members of the PCAST.  If also serving as the Director of the\nOffice of Science and Technology Policy, the APST may designate the U.S. Chief\nTechnology Officer as a member.  The remaining members shall be distinguished\nindividuals and representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government\nappointed by the President.  These non-Federal members shall have diverse\nperspectives and expertise in science, technology, education, and innovation.\n(c)  The APST and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall serve as Co-Chairs\nof the PCAST.  The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the PCAST\nfrom among the non-Federal members of the PCAST, to support the Co-Chairs in the\nleadership and organization of the PCAST.\n\n\nSec. 3.  Functions.  (a)  The PCAST shall advise the President on matters\ninvolving science, technology, education, and innovation policy.  The Council\nshall also provide the President with scientific and technical information that\nis needed to inform public policy relating to the American economy, the American\nworker, national and homeland security, and other topics.\n(b)  The PCAST shall meet regularly and shall:\n(i)    respond to requests from the President or the Co-Chairs for information,\nanalysis, evaluation, or advice;\n(ii)   solicit information and ideas from a broad range of stakeholders,\nincluding the research community; the private sector; universities; national\nlaboratories; State, local, and Tribal governments; foundations; and nonprofit\norganizations;\n(iii)  serve as the advisory committee identified in section 101(b) of the\nHigh-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-194), as amended (15\nU.S.C. 5511(b)), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the President’s\nInnovation and Technology Advisory Committee; and\n(iv)    serve as the advisory panel identified in section 4 of the 21st Century\nNanotechnology Research and Development Act (Public Law 108-153), as amended (15\nU.S.C. 7503), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the National\nNanotechnology Advisory Panel.\n(c)  The PCAST shall provide advice from the non-Federal sector to the National\nScience and Technology Council (NSTC) in response to requests from the NSTC.\n\n\nSec. 4.  Administration.  (a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies\nshall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the PCAST with information\nconcerning scientific and technological matters when requested by the PCAST\nCo-Chairs and as required for the purpose of carrying out the PCAST’s functions.\n(b)  In consultation with the Co-Chairs, the PCAST is authorized to create\nstanding subcommittees and ad hoc groups, including technical advisory groups,\nto assist the PCAST and provide preliminary information directly to the PCAST.\n(c)  In order to allow the PCAST to provide advice and analysis regarding\nclassified matters, the Co-Chairs may request that members of the PCAST, its\nstanding subcommittees, or ad hoc groups who do not hold a current clearance for\naccess to classified information receive security clearance and access\ndeterminations pursuant to Executive Order 12968 of August 2, 1995 (Access to\nClassified Information), as amended, or any successor order.\n(d)  The Department of Energy shall provide such funding and administrative and\ntechnical support as the PCAST may require, to the extent permitted by law and\nas authorized by existing appropriations.\n(e)  Members of the PCAST shall serve without any compensation for their work on\nthe PCAST, but may receive travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of\nsubsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the\ngovernment service (5 U.S.C. 5701–5707).\n(f)  Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.),\nmay apply to the PCAST, any functions of the President under that Act, except\nthat of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of\nEnergy, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the\nAdministrator of General Services.\n\n\nSec. 5.  Termination.  The PCAST shall terminate 2 years from the date of this\norder unless extended by the President.\n\n\nSec. 6.  Revocation.  Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s\nCouncil of Advisors on Science and Technology), as amended by Executive Order\n14109 of September 29, 2023 (Continuance of Certain Federal Advisory Committees\nand Amendments to Other Executive Orders), is hereby revoked.\n\n\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to\nimpair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the\nhead thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget\nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject\nto the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit,\nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against\nthe United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers,\nemployees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n    January 23, 2025.",
