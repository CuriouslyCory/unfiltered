# Analysis of Executive Order—Restoring the Death Penalty and Protecting Public Safety

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, seeks to reinstate and aggressively pursue the death penalty at the federal level, while also encouraging states to do the same.

## Key points

- **Purpose:** The order aims to deter violent crime through capital punishment and to reverse actions that have limited the death penalty's application.
- **Federal Action:** The Attorney General is directed to pursue the death penalty for all eligible crimes, prioritize cases involving the murder of law enforcement officers and capital crimes by illegal aliens, and modify the Justice Manual to align with this policy.
- **State Action:** The order encourages states to pursue capital punishment, including ensuring sufficient supplies for lethal injections. It also directs the Attorney General to take action to ensure that states can execute criminals.
- **Legal Challenges:** The order seeks to challenge and overrule Supreme Court precedents that limit the use of capital punishment.

## Areas of Concern

- **Aggressive Expansion:** The order seeks to broadly expand the use of the death penalty which could lead to its application in cases not warranting its use.
- **Potential Overreach:** Directing the Attorney General to seek the death penalty in specific cases regardless of other factors, such as cases involving undocumented aliens, could be construed as discriminatory and might lead to disparate applications of justice.
- **Undermining Precedent:** The order explicitly aims to overturn established Supreme Court precedents which could disrupt the legal system and the separation of powers.
- **State Authority:** The order attempts to influence state judicial and prosecutorial actions, potentially infringing on states rights.
- **Ethical concerns:** The executive order demonstrates a disregard for existing legal processes and a willingness to push for potentially unjust outcomes, reflecting an ethical issue.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Eighth Amendment:** The order may violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment if the expansion of the death penalty leads to its application in cases not fitting its historic use.
- **Separation of Powers:** Directing the Attorney General to overrule Supreme Court precedents could violate the separation of powers by undermining the judicial system.
- **Fourteenth Amendment:** The order's emphasis on pursuing the death penalty for certain groups, such as illegal aliens, may violate the equal protection clause by singling out individuals for harsher punishment based on their immigration status.
- **Due Process:** Prioritizing certain types of cases could lead to procedural shortcuts and undermine due process rights for defendants.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Increase in Executions:** If fully implemented, the order could lead to a rapid increase in executions at both the federal and state level.
- **Legal Challenges:** The order's various provisions will almost certainly be met with legal challenges based on constitutional grounds and may require prolonged litigation.
- **Erosion of Civil Liberties:** The aggressive pursuit of the death penalty could erode civil liberties and lead to injustices in the judicial process.
- **Erosion of Federalism:** The order’s attempt to influence state judicial action may lead to conflict between states and the federal government, undermining federalism.

Final Summary:

This Executive Order seeks to broadly expand the use of the death penalty, prioritize certain cases based on factors that could be considered discriminatory, and seeks to overturn established legal precedents. Its aggressive nature and focus may pose substantial constitutional and ethical questions as well as undermine the judicial process and erode civil liberties.
