# Analysis of Executive Order—Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, aims to reform the federal hiring process, emphasizing merit, skills, and dedication to the Constitution.

## Key Points

- **Focus on Merit:** The order stresses hiring based on merit, practical skills, and dedication to the Constitution.
- **Rejection of "Impermissible Factors":** It explicitly prohibits hiring based on race, sex, or religion, and it rejects consideration of factors such as "equity" or "gender identity."
- **Federal Hiring Plan:** It directs the development of a Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days, focusing on highly skilled individuals who are dedicated to American ideals.
- **Efficiency and Communication:** The plan mandates improved efficiency, communication with candidates, and the integration of modern technology in hiring.
- **Accountability and Reporting:** It requires the establishment of performance metrics and regular agency analysis of the reforms.

## Areas of Concern

- **Exclusion of Diversity Factors:** The explicit rejection of race, sex, religion, "equity", or "gender identity" could lead to a lack of diversity and potential discrimination in hiring practices.
- **Vague Language:** Terms like “American ideals, values, and interests” could be interpreted arbitrarily, leading to biased hiring practices.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The emphasis on hiring individuals “willing to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch” could be used to prioritize loyalty over competence and could curtail the civil rights of federal employees.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Equal Protection:** The order's explicit rejection of considering race, sex, and religion in hiring may conflict with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits discrimination based on these factors.
- **First Amendment:** The order's emphasis on loyalty to the Executive Branch and willingness to defend the Constitution could potentially infringe upon the First Amendment rights of federal employees, especially freedom of speech and association.
- **Merit Systems Principles:** The order emphasizes merit, but the exclusion of diversity considerations may undermine the merit system principles outlined in Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which also emphasize diversity.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Homogenous Federal Workforce:** The order could result in a less diverse and potentially less effective Federal workforce.
- **Discrimination:** The explicit prohibition of considering certain factors could lead to discrimination and marginalization of underrepresented groups.
- **Political Loyalty:** The emphasis on loyalty to the Executive Branch could lead to a politicized workforce, undermining the principle of a neutral civil service.

Final Summary: This Executive Order seeks to reform the federal hiring process by emphasizing merit and efficiency but raises serious concerns about potential discrimination, lack of diversity, and politicization of the federal workforce. Its implementation could conflict with constitutional principles and harm the civil service.
