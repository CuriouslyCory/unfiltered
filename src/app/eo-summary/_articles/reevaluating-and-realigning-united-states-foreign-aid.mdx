# Analysis of Executive Order—Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid

This executive order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, mandates a 90-day pause on U.S. foreign development assistance to review and realign it with the President's foreign policy.

## Key points

- **90-Day Pause:** Imposes a 90-day pause on new obligations and disbursements of foreign development assistance funds.
- **Review Process:** Orders reviews of all foreign assistance programs to assess efficiency and alignment with U.S. foreign policy.
- **Secretary of State Authority:** Grants the Secretary of State significant power to decide on the continuation, modification, or cessation of programs, and to approve new programs.
- **OMB Involvement:** Requires consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviews and determinations.
- **Waiver Provision:** Allows the Secretary of State to waive the pause for specific programs.

## Areas of Concern

- **Overly Broad Discretion:** The order grants broad discretionary power to the Secretary of State, potentially leading to politically motivated decisions in foreign aid distribution.
- **Potential Disruption:** A 90-day pause could significantly disrupt ongoing aid programs and negatively impact recipients.
- **Vague Criteria:** The order’s criteria for aligning foreign aid with the “foreign policy of the President” are vague and could be interpreted in many ways.
- **Undermining of Foreign Policy Consensus:** The language that current foreign aid is “antithetical to American values” seems to dismiss international consensus and could weaken alliances.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers**: The order does not seem to overtly undermine the separation of powers. However, the broad discretionary powers it vests in the Secretary of State in determining foreign aid could lead to questions of whether the power of the purse (appropriations, which belongs to Congress) is being circumvented.
- **Congressional Authority:** While the executive branch has authority over foreign policy, Congress has power over funding. There is a potential for conflict if the executive branch uses this order to bypass Congressional intent.
- **Due process**: The executive order does not address potential due process concerns with respect to the foreign aid recipients, and the order does not include any appeal process.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Reduced Aid Effectiveness:** The pause could lead to delays and a reduction in effectiveness of ongoing assistance programs and could disrupt critical aid delivery during crises.
- **Damage to Alliances:** The reassessment could damage relationships with allies if foreign assistance is viewed as a political tool.
- **Uncertainty and Instability:** The order creates uncertainty for international aid organizations and recipient countries.
- **Risk of abuse:** The broad discretion given to the Secretary of State to pick and choose which programs to continue poses the risk of politically driven aid decisions, rewarding allies and punishing adversaries.

Final Summary: The Executive Order aims to overhaul the existing U.S. foreign aid system by introducing a 90-day pause and review of all programs to be aligned with the President’s foreign policy agenda. This could result in a more politicized system of foreign aid distribution, and potentially undermine the effectiveness of aid and relations with allies.
