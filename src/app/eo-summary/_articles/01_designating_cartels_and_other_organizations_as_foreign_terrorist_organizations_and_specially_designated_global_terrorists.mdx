# Analysis of Executive Order—Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists

This Executive Order, signed on January 20, 2025, aims to designate certain international cartels and other organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists.

## Key points

-   **Purpose:** Creates a process for designating international cartels and other organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists.
-   **National Security Threat:** Identifies international cartels as a national security threat due to their convergence with foreign terrorist organizations and antagonistic governments, complex adaptive systems, and infiltration into foreign governments.
-   **Cartel Activities:** Highlights the cartels’ violence, terror, drug trafficking, and control over illegal traffic across the southern border.
-   **Other Organizations:** Includes Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) as similar threats to the United States.
-   **National Emergency:** Declares a national emergency to deal with the threat posed by these organizations.
-   **Policy:** Aims to eliminate these organizations’ presence in the US and their ability to threaten US territory, safety, and security.
-  **Implementation:** Directs the Secretary of State to recommend designations within 14 days and directs Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare for potential invocation of Alien Enemies Act.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Broad Definition:** The language used to define cartels and other organizations may be overly broad, potentially leading to the misapplication of terrorist designations.
-  **Potential for Abuse:** The designation of groups as terrorist organizations could be used to justify excessive force or overreach by the government.
-   **Due Process:** The executive order may not provide sufficient due process for organizations and individuals who are designated.
-   **Alien Enemies Act:** The potential invocation of the Alien Enemies Act could result in the expedited removal of individuals without adequate legal process.
-   **Emergency Declaration:** The declaration of a national emergency, without clear parameters, could grant the executive branch unchecked powers.

## Constitutional Considerations:

-   **Separation of Powers:** The executive order may be viewed as an overreach of executive power, potentially infringing on the legislative and judicial branches.
-   **Due Process Clause (5th and 14th Amendments):** The order may not fully satisfy due process requirements, particularly with the potential expedited removal of individuals.
-   **First Amendment (Freedom of Association):** The designation of groups as terrorist organizations could violate the rights to freedom of assembly and association if individuals are targeted based on group membership.
-  **Emergency Powers:** The invocation of emergency powers under IEEPA raises concerns about the scope of presidential authority and potential for abuse.

**Potential Implications:**

-   **Increased Government Surveillance:** The order could lead to increased surveillance of communities and individuals associated with designated groups.
-  **Civil Liberties Violations:** The broad language of the order and the potential invocation of the Alien Enemies Act could result in the violation of civil liberties.
-   **International Relations:** Designating cartels as terrorist groups may complicate US relations with other countries.
-  **Erosion of Checks and Balances:** The use of executive orders to broadly designate groups as terrorist organizations could undermine the system of checks and balances.

Final Summary
This executive order raises significant constitutional, ethical, and practical concerns. Its broad language, potential for abuse, and lack of clear due process protections warrant careful review. The potential invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, the broad designation of organizations, and the declaration of a national emergency may lead to serious consequences and undermine civil liberties.
