# Analysis of Executive Order—Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service

This executive order, signed January 20, 2025, outlines a plan to reform the federal hiring process, emphasizing merit, practical skill, and dedication to the Constitution. It aims to eliminate factors such as commitment to racial equity and gender identity from hiring considerations.

## Key Points

-   **Focus on Merit:** The order emphasizes hiring based on merit, practical skills, and dedication to the Constitution, explicitly rejecting considerations of race, sex, and religion, as well as “gender identity.”
-   **Federal Hiring Plan:** Requires the development of a Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days, prioritizing individuals committed to improving government efficiency and upholding the Constitution.
-   **Specific Agency Plans:** Mandates the improvement of Senior Executive Service position allocation in key agencies to facilitate democratic leadership.
-   **Accountability and Reporting:** Requires the Office of Personnel Management to establish performance metrics and monitor progress.
-   **Efficiency Goals:** Sets a goal to decrease government-wide time-to-hire to under 80 days and improve communication with candidates.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Exclusionary Language:** The explicit rejection of “equity” and “gender identity” as factors could be used to discriminate against certain groups, despite the stated aim to not consider race, sex, or religion.
-   **Ambiguous Criteria:** Terms like “American ideals” and “values” can be interpreted subjectively, potentially leading to bias in hiring decisions.
-   **Potential for Discrimination:** The emphasis on “defending the Constitution” and “faithfully serving the Executive Branch” could be used to disqualify individuals with differing political views or who criticize government policies.
-   **Overreach:** The executive order could potentially interfere with the ability of agencies to implement diversity programs and initiatives.

## Constitutional Considerations

-   **Equal Protection:** While the order prohibits considering race, sex, and religion, it expresses disapproval of “equity” and “gender identity,” which could be used to justify discrimination, violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.
-   **First Amendment:** The focus on “defending the Constitution” and “faithfully serving the Executive Branch” could impinge on freedom of speech and association.

**Potential Implications**

-   **Reduced Diversity:** The explicit language of the order could result in a less diverse federal workforce.
-   **Legal Challenges:** The language used in the order, particularly in regards to equity and gender identity, could be the subject of legal challenges, potentially due to discrimination.
-   **Disputes in Hiring:** There will be disputes in implementing subjective values and ideals during the hiring process.

Final Summary
This executive order aims to reform federal hiring practices by focusing on merit, but its specific language raises concerns about potential discrimination and limitations on constitutional rights. The order could face legal challenges if implemented as written.
