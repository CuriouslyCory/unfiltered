# Analysis of Executive Order—Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements

This Executive Order, signed on January 20, 2025, directs the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement and other related international environmental agreements, while prioritizing American economic interests.

## Key points

- **Withdrawal from Paris Agreement:** Mandates immediate formal notification of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
- **Withdrawal from other agreements:** Directs withdrawal from any agreement, pact, or accord made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
- **Revocation of Financial Commitments:** Requires immediate cessation or revocation of any financial commitments made by the United States under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
- **Rescission of Climate Finance Plan:** Revokes and rescinds the U.S. International Climate Finance Plan and mandates guidance for the rescission of all frozen funds.
- **Prioritization of Economic Efficiency:** Prioritizes economic efficiency, American prosperity, consumer choice, and fiscal restraint in all foreign engagements concerning energy policy.

## Areas of Concern

- **Unilateral Withdrawal:** The withdrawal from international agreements could isolate the U.S. and undermine global efforts to address climate change. There was no attempt to work with partners to improve or change the agreements.
- **Environmental Impact:** The focus on economic growth at the expense of environmental agreements could result in increased pollution and damage to the environment.
- **International Relations:** Withdrawal from agreements may damage relationships with allies and undermine the leadership of the United States in global matters.
- **Lack of International Collaboration:** The document places a priority on American interests over collaboration on global issues. 

## Constitutional Considerations

- **Presidential Authority:** The executive order relies on the President's authority to conduct foreign policy, which is generally recognized. However, Congress has the power to regulate commerce and may challenge actions that undermine treaty obligations and their power to appropriate money.
- **Treaty Obligations:** While the President can withdraw from treaties, this action must be evaluated against the advice and consent of Congress, which has the power to ratify and unratify treaties.
- **Checks and Balances:** The order could potentially be challenged on the grounds that it circumvents Congressional authority, and its implementation may face legal challenges.

**Potential Implications**

- **Environmental Degradation:** The focus on economic growth without corresponding environmental protections could lead to environmental degradation. 
- **Economic Instability:** Isolationist policies and disregard of climate impacts could affect long-term economic stability.
- **Damaged Relationships:** The withdrawal from agreements could harm international relationships and lead to loss of trust. 
- **Long-term Costs:** The immediate economic gains could be outweighed by long-term environmental and societal costs.

Final Summary
This Executive Order directs the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and related climate change accords, prioritizing domestic economic growth and energy independence over international collaboration. The order raises concerns about environmental impact, international relations, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The long-term consequences of these policies could be detrimental to global efforts to combat climate change and may pose economic risks to the United States. Additionally, the order appears to completely disregard the fact that previous administrations worked to establish these international agreements. This unilateral action potentially undermines international cooperation on a global threat.
