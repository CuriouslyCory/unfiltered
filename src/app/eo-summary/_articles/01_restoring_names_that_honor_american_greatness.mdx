# Analysis of Executive Order—Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness

This Executive Order, signed on January 20, 2025, by an unnamed president, focuses on renaming geographic locations to honor "visionary and patriotic Americans." It specifically reinstates the name "Mount McKinley" and renames the "Gulf of Mexico" to the "Gulf of America."

## Key Points

-   **Reconstitution of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names:** Directs agencies to review and potentially replace current appointees to the Board on Geographic Names within seven days.
-   **Renaming Mount McKinley:** Orders the Secretary of the Interior to reinstate the name "Mount McKinley" within 30 days, honoring President William McKinley.
-  **Renaming the Gulf of Mexico:** Orders the Secretary of the Interior to rename the “Gulf of Mexico” as the “Gulf of America” within 30 days.
-   **Honoring Alaskan People:** Directs the Secretary of the Interior to collaborate with Alaska Native entities to adopt names for landmarks that honor their history and culture.
-   **Public Input:** Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Potential for Historical Revisionism:** The executive order's emphasis on "patriotic Americans" could lead to biased renaming decisions and potentially neglect the contributions and perspectives of diverse groups and historical figures.
-   **Disregard for Local and Cultural Significance:** Renaming natural landmarks without considering their existing historical or cultural significance can be disrespectful and cause discord.
-   **Executive Overreach:** While the President has authority over federal lands, unilaterally changing names like the Gulf of Mexico which is an international body of water, could be perceived as an overreach of power and could cause diplomatic strain with bordering nations.
-   **Lack of Transparency:** The order does not provide transparent criteria for selecting “patriotic Americans” and relies heavily on the Executive branch's discretion without additional guidance from the legislature.

## Constitutional Considerations

-   **Separation of Powers:** The directive to influence the U.S. Board on Geographic Names's composition and procedures could infringe on the Board's operational independence.
-   **First Amendment:** The selection process based on the executive branch's specific ideology could potentially violate the First Amendment's implied protections of free speech.

**Potential Implications**

-   **Public Dissatisfaction:**  Renaming of long-established geographical names can cause confusion, anger, and political division.
-   **Costly Implementation:**  Updating maps, contracts, and other documents across the federal government can result in costly and unnecessary expenses.
-   **Cultural Erasure:** The renaming process might erase or marginalize the cultural heritage of certain populations and historical narratives in favor of the administration's preference.

**Final Summary**

This Executive Order raises concerns about potential historical revisionism and unilateral decision-making in the naming of national landmarks and bodies of water. The push for honoring “patriotic Americans” without a transparent selection process is problematic. It shows a lack of respect for local and cultural heritage, raising questions about the separation of powers and potentially free speech. This order risks causing public dissatisfaction, incurring unnecessary expenses, and causing cultural erasure, along with potential diplomatic issues.
