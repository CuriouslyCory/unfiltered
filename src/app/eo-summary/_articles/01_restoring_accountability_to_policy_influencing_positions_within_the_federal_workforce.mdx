# Analysis of Executive Order—Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce

This executive order, signed on January 20, 2025, aims to restore accountability within the federal workforce by reinstating and amending Executive Order 13957, which creates a new employment category called "Policy/Career" positions. This order seeks to make it easier to remove civil service employees in policy-influencing roles.

## Key Points

-   **Reinstatement of Schedule F:** The order reinstates Executive Order 13957 (creating Schedule F), renaming it "Schedule Policy/Career".
-   **Expanded Definition:** The definition of positions eligible for Schedule Policy/Career is expanded to include those that supervise other employees in these positions or those designated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director.
-   **Removal of Protections:** Employees in Schedule Policy/Career can be dismissed for not faithfully implementing administration policies, even if they don't personally or politically support them.
-   **Revocation of EO 14003:** The order revokes Executive Order 14003, which had protected federal workers, and directs agencies to review and rescind related actions.
- **OPM Action:** The Director of OPM is tasked with amending regulations to remove civil service protections and to create new ones under the new "Policy/Career" designation.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Undermining Civil Service:** The order undermines civil service protections by making it easier to fire career employees in policy roles for disagreements with the administration’s policies, essentially changing "at will" employment practices to those positions. The lack of clear protections may result in the removal of experienced professionals without due process.
-   **Potential for Political Influence:** By allowing for the dismissal of employees who do not faithfully implement the current administration’s policies, the order risks politicizing the civil service and creating an environment where loyalty to a political party supersedes expertise and nonpartisanship. This could lead to policy decisions being driven more by political considerations rather than public interest.
-   **Vague Grounds for Dismissal:** The vague term "faithfully implement administration policies" could be broadly interpreted, creating uncertainty for employees and potential for abuse by administrations wanting to remove career civil servants.
-   **Reduced Accountability:** By removing protection for policy employees, the executive order may insulate bad actors and reduce overall accountability.

## Constitutional Considerations:

-   **Potential Violation of Due Process:** The executive order's provisions for employee removal for failing to "faithfully implement" policies, combined with the removal of due process protections, could violate constitutional guarantees of due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The lack of clear standards and a fair review process could make civil servant subject to arbitrary actions.
-   **Abuse of Executive Power:** The order could be seen as an overreach of executive authority, potentially disrupting the separation of powers by giving the President too much direct control over the career civil service, which should be based on merit, qualifications, and accountability, not political loyalty.

**Potential Implications:**

-   **Loss of Expertise:** The order could result in a mass exodus of experienced civil servants who disagree with the administration or feel threatened by its policies, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise.
-   **Increased Politicization:** The order could further politicize the federal workforce, making it less effective and more polarized.
-   **Instability and Inefficiency:** Frequent turnover and fear of reprisal may negatively impact the ability of government agencies to function effectively and efficiently.

Final Summary: This Executive Order seeks to greatly expand the ability of political leadership to remove career civil servants, and in doing so raises serious legal questions and poses a significant risk to a stable non-partisan government workforce.
