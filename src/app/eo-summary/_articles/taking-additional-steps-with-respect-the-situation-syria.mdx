# Analysis of Executive Order—Taking Additional Steps with Respect to the Situation in Syria

This executive order, signed by Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on January 15, 2025, amends Executive Order 13894, which addresses the situation in Syria.

## Key points

- **Amends EO 13894:** This order modifies Executive Order 13894 by removing specific references to Turkey's military actions in northeast Syria.
- **Expands Sanction Criteria:** It broadens the criteria for sanctions to include those who provide support to individuals whose assets are blocked under the order.
- **Removes Subsection:** It eliminates subsection 8(f) from the original order.

## Areas of Concern

- **Expanded Sanctions Scope:** The changes broaden the scope of sanctions, potentially affecting a larger group of individuals or entities.
- **Lack of Specificity:** The order lacks detailed specifics about how it is to be implemented or who it is specifically targeting, raising concerns about overreach.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Presidential Authority:** The order invokes the President's authority under the Constitution and various laws, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the National Emergencies Act, and the Immigration and Nationality Act.
- **Checks and Balances:** While the order states it does not create any enforceable rights against the U.S., its implementation could face legal challenges if it infringes on rights or exceeds statutory authority.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Increased Sanctions:** The amendments could result in more individuals and entities being subjected to sanctions, with potential impacts on humanitarian efforts and regional stability.
- **Foreign Relations:** The order may affect U.S. relations with other countries involved in the Syrian conflict, particularly Turkey.
- **Legal Challenges:** The expansion of sanction criteria could lead to legal challenges based on due process and overreach.

Final Summary: This executive order modifies an existing order related to Syria, broadening the scope of sanctions and removing references to specific actions by Turkey. The implications could include increased sanctions, shifts in foreign relations, and potential legal challenges.
