# Analysis of Executive Order—Application of Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, addresses the enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (the \"Act\") with respect to TikTok. It temporarily halts the enforcement of the Act to allow the new administration to review the national security concerns and negotiate a resolution.

## Key points

- **Temporary Halt:** The order directs the Attorney General to halt enforcement of the Act for 75 days to allow a review of national security concerns related to TikTok.
- **No Penalties:** During this 75-day period, the Department of Justice will not enforce the Act or impose penalties on any entity for noncompliance, including distribution, maintenance, or updates of TikTok.
- **Prior Conduct Exempt:** The order ensures that the Department of Justice will not penalize any conduct that occurred during the 75-day period, or before the order was issued, including the time from the Act's effective date to the signing of the order.
- **Guidance Required:** The Attorney General is tasked with issuing written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a).
- **Letter of No Violation:** The Attorney General must issue letters to providers stating that no violation of the statute has occurred and that there is no liability during the specified periods.
- **Exclusive Executive Authority:** The order asserts that the enforcement of the Act rests exclusively with the Executive branch and directs the Attorney General to defend against state or private attempts to enforce it.

## Areas of Concern

- **Potential Overreach of Executive Power:** The order could be seen as an attempt to unilaterally suspend a law passed by Congress, which may raise concerns about the separation of powers.
- **Delaying Congressional Intent:** The 75-day delay could be viewed as undermining the intent of the Act.
- **Scope of Non-Enforcement:** The order's blanket exemption for past actions might pose challenges, especially if violations occurred that would otherwise be subject to penalties.
- **Executive Enforcement Control:** The order's language asserting that states or private enforcement represents \"an encroachment on the powers of the Executive\" could be interpreted as an overassertion of executive authority.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers:** The order tests the balance between the executive and legislative branches. The executive branch is not normally allowed to unilaterally suspend laws passed by congress.
- **Enforcement Discretion:** While the executive branch has enforcement discretion, a blanket non-enforcement mandate could be problematic in the absence of formal congressional amendment or repeal.
- **Article II Powers:** The President has constitutional responsibilities for national security and foreign policy but these powers are subject to constitutional and legal limitations.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Legal Challenges:** The order is likely to face legal challenges based on separation of powers arguments and potential overreach of executive authority.
- **Erosion of Legislative Authority:** If the executive branch unilaterally delays the implementation of a congressional act, this may erode the legislative branch's authority.
- **Negotiation of Resolution:** The order is setting the stage for a negotiation with TikTok that may not be in the best interest of National Security.

Final Summary
This executive order aims to temporarily halt the enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act concerning TikTok, citing the need for a review of national security concerns and for a negotiation. It suspends enforcement for 75 days and gives exemptions for conduct before the issuance of the order. However, it also raises several concerns about executive overreach, separation of powers, and enforcement discretion, which could lead to significant legal and political challenges. The order may be seen as undermining congressional intent and may require further review to ensure it aligns with the constitution.
