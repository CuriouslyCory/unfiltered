# Analysis of Executive Order—Application of Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, temporarily suspends the enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act as it applies to TikTok, granting a 75-day period for the Administration to review national security issues and seek a resolution.

## Key Points

- **Suspension of Enforcement:** The order directs the Attorney General to halt enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act concerning TikTok for 75 days.
- **Review and Resolution:** The order aims to allow the administration to assess national security concerns related to TikTok and seek a resolution that protects security while saving a widely used communications platform.
- **No Enforcement During the Period:** No penalties will be imposed for noncompliance with the Act during the 75-day period or prior to the order's issuance (from January 19, 2025, to the signing date).
- **Guidance for Providers:** The Attorney General is instructed to provide written guidance and letters to providers indicating no violations and no liability during the specified periods.
- **Exclusive Executive Authority:** The order asserts the executive branch's exclusive authority to enforce the Act and to prevent any enforcement by States or private parties.

## Areas of Concern

- **Interference with an existing Law:** The executive order interferes with a law passed by the legislature by delaying and suspending its enforcement.
- **Overreach of Executive Power:** The executive order prevents any legal action regarding the law from the date of its effective period to the signing of the order, including previous violations.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The order’s broad language could be interpreted as giving the executive branch unchecked power over enforcement of laws.
- **Undermining Checks and Balances:** By stating that the enforcement by the States or private parties is an “encroachment on the power of the Executive”, the order undermines the balance of powers and the rights of the states.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers:** The order might be interpreted as an overreach of executive power, encroaching upon the legislative branch's power to enact laws.
- **Article II:** While the President has constitutional responsibilities for national security, the order’s suspension of enforcement for a law, combined with its retroactive protection, appears to challenge the separation of powers.
- **Due Process:** Retroactive suspension of enforcement can affect due process rights, as entities may have relied on the law passed by the legislature.

**Potential Implications**

- **Delay of National Security Concerns:** The 75-day suspension might postpone actions necessary to address national security risks posed by TikTok, despite the intent to protect national security.
- **Uncertainty for TikTok:** The order may introduce legal uncertainty for TikTok and its users, pending the administration’s review and the possibility of future enforcement.
- **Erosion of Legislative Authority:** The executive branch's actions can set a precedent for weakening legislative authority and could result in further executive overreach.
- **Challenged Legality:** The order could face legal challenges from the legislative or judicial branches due to the separation of powers concerns.

Final Summary
The executive order suspends the enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act regarding TikTok for 75 days to allow for administrative review and resolution. It raises concerns about the separation of powers, and it grants the Executive broad authority over the application and enforcement of existing law.
