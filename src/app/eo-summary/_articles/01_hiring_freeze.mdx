# Analysis of Hiring Freeze Executive Order

This executive order, issued on January 20, 2025, mandates a freeze on the hiring of Federal civilian employees across the executive branch.

## Key points

- **Hiring Freeze:** All vacant Federal civilian positions as of noon on January 20, 2025, cannot be filled, and new positions cannot be created.
- **Exceptions:** The order excludes military personnel, positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, and public safety, as well as provisions for Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans’ benefits. The OPM Director may grant further exemptions.
- **Workforce Reduction Plan:** The OMB Director, in consultation with the Director of OPM and the Administrator of the USDS, must submit a plan within 90 days to reduce the Federal workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.
- **IRS Exception:** The hiring freeze will remain in effect for the IRS until lifted by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the Director of OMB and the Administrator of USDS.
- **Contracting Prohibition:** Federal departments and agencies are prohibited from contracting outside the Federal Government to circumvent this order.
- **Personnel Reallocation:** Agencies may reallocate existing personnel and funds to meet high-priority needs, maintain essential services, and protect national security, homeland security, and public safety.
- **Exempted Appointments:**  The order does not limit Presidential or Senate appointments, appointments to non-career positions in the Senior Executive Service, Schedule A or C positions in the Excepted Service, and other non-career positions approved by agency leadership appointed by the President. Nor does it limit personnel hires where conflicts with law arise.
- **Collective Bargaining:** The order does not abrogate any collective bargaining agreement in effect on the date of the memorandum.

## Areas of Concern

- **Potential Service Disruption:** The hiring freeze could disrupt essential government services due to staffing shortages, particularly if the workforce reduction plan is not well-implemented.
- **Over Reliance on Contracting:**  While explicitly prohibited, there may be pressure to use contractors to circumvent the freeze, which may result in less transparency and increased costs.
- **Impact on Efficiency:** The directive to reallocate resources and personnel may cause internal inefficiencies as agencies try to adapt to the new requirements.
- **Disproportionate Impact:** The focus on attrition and efficiency may have a disproportionate impact on certain agencies or demographics.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Presidential Authority:** The President's power to issue executive orders is generally accepted, but must be within constitutional limits.  This order appears to fall within the President’s authority to manage the executive branch.
- **Separation of Powers:** There are no explicit violations of the separation of powers since this order pertains primarily to the executive branch. However, Congress has the power to appropriate funds and could use the budget process to counter the executive order. Congressional oversight will be key to ensure the executive branch doesn't overreach.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Reduced Federal Workforce:** The order aims to reduce the size of the Federal workforce through a hiring freeze, attrition, and efficiency improvements, which could have long-term impacts on the quality of federal services.
- **Potential for Delays:** The order might lead to longer waiting times for public services as the government operates with fewer employees.
- **Morale Implications:** The hiring freeze could negatively impact the morale of federal employees, especially those anticipating new hires.
- **Increased Workload:** Existing staff may experience an increased workload due to staff vacancies and the focus on efficiency improvements.

Final Summary

This Executive Order aims to reduce the size of the Federal workforce by implementing a hiring freeze and tasking OMB with creating a workforce reduction plan. While intended to streamline government, the order has the potential to disrupt essential services, reduce morale, and create other unforeseen issues. The implementation and oversight of the order will be crucial in determining its ultimate success and overall impact.
