# Analysis of Executive Order—Designation of Ansar Allah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 22, 2025, directs the process for designating Ansar Allah (the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

## Key points

- **Purpose:** Initiates process for designating Ansar Allah (Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO).
- **Rationale:** Cites Houthis' attacks on U.S. Navy warships, civilian infrastructure, and commercial vessels, and their support by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF).
- **Policy:** Aims to cooperate with regional partners to eliminate Ansar Allah’s capabilities and operations and end their attacks.
- **Implementation:** Directs the Secretary of State to submit a report on the designation within 30 days and to take action on the designation within 15 days after submitting the report.
- **USAID Review:** Mandates a review of USAID partners in Yemen to identify those who have made payments to, or criticized international efforts against, Ansar Allah.
- **Termination of Projects:** Directs USAID to terminate projects, grants, or contracts with identified entities.

## Areas of Concern

- **Expedited Timeline:** The order sets a short timeframe for the Secretary of State to prepare and act on the FTO designation, which may not allow for sufficient analysis or consideration of unintended consequences.
- **Broad Scope of Review:** The review of USAID partners may impact aid delivery to vulnerable populations in Yemen, particularly in areas controlled by the Houthis.
- **Potential for Overreach:** The order could lead to a broad interpretation of "criticism" and could affect legitimate humanitarian organizations working in the region.
- **Impact on Humanitarian Aid:** The termination of projects may impede humanitarian aid delivery to vulnerable populations and could have unintended consequences.

## Constitutional Considerations

- **Executive Authority:** The order is based on the President's authority under the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including the INA.
- **Checks and Balances:** While the executive branch has the power to designate FTOs, Congressional oversight would be essential to ensure adherence to legal and humanitarian standards.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Escalation of Conflict:** Designating the Houthis as an FTO could escalate conflict in the region and further destabilize Yemen.
- **Humanitarian Crisis:** Cutting off funding and support to legitimate humanitarian organizations could worsen the existing humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
- **International Relations:** Could strain relations with other nations that may have different perspectives on the conflict.
- **Legal Challenges:** The designation could face legal challenges, especially concerning the fairness and due process of FTO designations.

Final Summary: The executive order initiates a process to designate Ansar Allah as an FTO and aims to counter their activities by cutting their funding and support networks and countering their attacks. The expedited nature of the process along with potential impacts on aid and humanitarian work require careful monitoring and oversight.
