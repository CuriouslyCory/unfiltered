# Analysis of Regulatory Freeze Pending Review Executive Order

This Executive Order, signed on January 20, 2025, mandates a regulatory freeze pending review. It instructs executive departments and agencies to halt the proposal or issuance of any new rule until reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2025. The order also directs the withdrawal of rules sent to the OFR but not published, and to consider postponing effective dates of published or issued but not yet effective rules by 60 days.

## Key points

-   **Rule Freeze:** All agencies are prohibited from proposing or issuing any rule until a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2025, reviews and approves it.
-   **Withdrawal of UnPublished Rules:** Agencies must withdraw rules sent to the OFR but not published in the Federal Register for review and approval under the new process.
-   **Postponement of Effective Dates:** Agencies must consider postponing the effective dates of published or issued but not yet effective rules for 60 days for review, and consider public comments during this period, and reevaluating pending petitions related to these rules.
-   **OMB Oversight:** The OMB Director is responsible for overseeing the implementation of this memorandum, including a process to review pending collections of information.
-   **Scope of Rule:** Includes all rules defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(4), any “regulatory action,” as defined in Executive Order 12866, and “guidance documents” as defined in Executive Order 13891, as well as agency actions leading to a rule or guidance, including proposed rules.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Broad Scope:** The executive order's broad definition of 'rule' could encompass many agency actions, leading to a wide-ranging freeze with potential impacts on various sectors.
-  **Potential for Delay:** The directive to potentially postpone effective dates of regulations could create uncertainty, impede policy implementation, and lead to disruption in various sectors.
-   **Centralized Control:** The requirement that the OMB Director oversee implementation concentrates regulatory power and could delay critical actions.
-   **Lack of Transparency:** While a comment period is mentioned, the ultimate decision-making process lacks full transparency, and the criteria for what constitutes 'substantial questions' isn't explicit.
-   **Potential for Political Influence:** Centralized review of regulations could introduce political considerations into what should be objective decision-making.

## Constitutional Considerations:

-   **Separation of Powers:** While Presidents have some authority over the executive branch, this sweeping regulatory freeze could impinge on the power of agencies and Congress to implement laws through regulations. 
-   **Due Process:** The postponement of effective dates for regulations could create instability, and the lack of clear criteria for what constitutes "substantial questions of fact, law, or policy" could raise due process concerns for affected parties.
-   **Administrative Procedures Act (APA):** Changes to established procedures of agencies or modifications to existing rules through this mechanism must comply with the APA.

**Potential Implications:**

-   **Significant Delays:** The regulatory freeze and review process could lead to significant delays in the implementation of new rules.
-   **Policy Uncertainty:** Businesses and other stakeholders may face uncertainty due to the changes or delays in regulation implementation.
-   **Impact on Public Services:** Regulations essential for public services could be delayed or indefinitely halted by this order.
-   **Increased Centralization:** Could lead to increased power of OMB at the expense of the line agencies with specific expertise. 

Final Summary
This executive order imposes a broad regulatory freeze that could cause widespread delays and uncertainty. By mandating that all rules undergo review under a process controlled by the executive branch, it raises concerns about transparency, efficiency, and the balance of power. The potential impact on public services and the lack of clear criteria for action make this a concerning executive action.
