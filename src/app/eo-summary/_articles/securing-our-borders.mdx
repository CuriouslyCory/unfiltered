# Analysis of Executive Order—Securing Our Borders

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, outlines measures to secure US borders, particularly the southern border, with a focus on deterring illegal entry, detaining and removing aliens, and resuming certain border control protocols.

## Key Points:

- **Border Security Measures:** Includes building a physical wall and other barriers, deploying personnel, and using technology to secure the southern border.
- **Detention and Removal:** Mandates the detention of aliens apprehended for immigration violations and their prompt removal.
- **Resumption of Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP):** Orders the resumption of MPP, requiring aliens to be returned to the territory they came from while awaiting removal proceedings.
- **Parole Policies Adjustment:** Seeks to cease using the "CBP One" application for parole and terminate categorical parole programs, including the "Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans".
- **International Cooperation:** Promotes international agreements to facilitate border security.
- **DNA and Identification:** Requires DNA collection for detained aliens and use of technology to verify familial relationships.
- **Prosecution of Border-Related Offenses:** Prioritizes prosecution of offenses related to human smuggling, trafficking, and child exploitation.
- **Additional Measures:** Directs agencies to provide recommendations on additional authority to secure the border.

## Areas of Concern:

- **Broad Detention Powers:** The order directs agencies to detain aliens to the fullest extent permitted by law, which could lead to prolonged detention and potential due process issues.
- **Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP):** Resuming MPP raises concerns about the safety and well-being of asylum seekers returned to potentially dangerous conditions.
- **Parole Policies:** Ceasing the use of the "CBP One" application and terminating existing parole programs may limit the pathways for legal entry into the US.
- **Potential Overreach of Authority:** The language of the order calls for all "appropriate action" which can be interpreted in such a way that it violates existing laws and judicial precedents.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Due Process:** The broad detention powers and potential removal procedures may impinge on the due process rights of those seeking asylum or entering the US.
- **Right to Seek Asylum:** The order may conflict with international laws and treaties protecting the right to seek asylum, specifically the right to have a process of asylum and not be summarily returned to potential harm.
- **Separation of Powers:** While the executive branch has authority over immigration enforcement, the measures taken must be consistent with the law and may not infringe on the powers of the judicial branch. The executive branch cannot write or interpret the law.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The broad language regarding detention and removal could lead to abuses of power and the mistreatment of individuals seeking entry to the US.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Humanitarian Concerns:** The order could lead to a humanitarian crisis at the border, with large numbers of people being detained or returned to potentially dangerous conditions.
- **Legal Challenges:** The order is likely to face legal challenges from civil rights groups and others who argue that it violates constitutional rights and international law.
- **Diplomatic Fallout:** The order may strain relationships with other countries, particularly those from which many migrants originate.
- **Increased backlog in the immigration court system:** Mandating detention will increase the need for more immigration judges and court staff.

Final Summary: This executive order is an attempt by the executive branch to use its powers over immigration enforcement. However, its broad language and calls for actions that would potentially violate the constitution or international law makes it a dangerous and unconstitutional document.
