# Analysis of Executive Order—Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential

TLDR; This Executive Order aims to maximize resource development in Alaska by reversing previous restrictions and expediting permitting for energy and natural resource projects.

## Key points

- **Resource Development:** The order emphasizes the development of Alaska's energy, mineral, timber, and seafood resources.
- **Reversal of Restrictions:** It seeks to reverse the restrictions on resource development implemented by the previous administration.
- **Expedited Permitting:** It calls for the expedited permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects in Alaska.
- **LNG Prioritization:** The order prioritizes the development of Alaska's liquified natural gas (LNG) potential.
- **Agency Actions:** It directs various agencies to rescind, revoke, revise, amend, defer, or grant exemptions from regulations that are inconsistent with the policy set forth in the order.
- **ANWR:** The order withdraws Secretarial Order 3401, which halted activities in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and reinstates previous leasing programs.
- **Road to King Cove:** The order facilitates the expedited development of a road corridor between the community of King Cove and the airport in Cold Bay.
- **Review of Waterways:** It directs a review of waterways in Alaska to determine ownership and restore rights to the state.

## Areas of Concern

- **Environmental Impact:** The order raises concerns about potential environmental damage due to the expedited resource development and reversal of environmental protections.
- **Subsistence:** The emphasis on maximizing resource development could impact subsistence hunting and fishing practices of local communities.
- **Alaska Native Lands:** It directs a review of all Department of the Interior guidance regarding the taking of Alaska Native lands into trust, raising concern for potential conflicts with indigenous land rights.
- **Agency Overreach:** The order directs executive departments and agencies to take actions that may exceed their authority, such as amending regulations outside the normal rulemaking process.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers:** The executive order's broad directives to agencies to rescind rules and regulations may raise concerns about the separation of powers.
- **Due Process:** Expedited permitting and reversals of decisions without due process and analysis may pose a risk to environmental protection.
- **ANILCA and Other Acts:** The order directs reviews to ensure actions are consistent with the Alaska Statehood Act of 1958, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.
- **Equal Footing Doctrine:** The order directs a review of waterways which could impact the application of the equal footing doctrine.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Environmental Degradation:** Increased resource development could lead to environmental degradation and habitat loss.
- **Community Impact:** Resource development could negatively impact local communities.
- **Legal Challenges:** The executive order is likely to face legal challenges based on environmental and procedural grounds.
- **Economic Impact:** The order aims to boost the nation’s economic and energy security, but the long-term environmental and societal effects may undermine such gains.
- **Tribal Rights:** The potential for conflict with indigenous land rights may occur.

Final Summary
This Executive Order seeks to rapidly develop Alaska’s natural resources, reversing previous policies that protected the environment. It raises several areas of concern related to its potential impacts on environmental protection, indigenous rights, and the separation of powers. The order appears to prioritize economic gain and national security interests over environmental protection and tribal rights. The order could face significant legal challenges.
