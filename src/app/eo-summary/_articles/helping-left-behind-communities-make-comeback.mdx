# Analysis of Executive Order—Helping Left-Behind Communities Make a Comeback

This Executive Order, signed by Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on January 19, 2025, aims to support economically distressed communities through a coordinated, whole-of-government approach. The order focuses on place-based economic development, targeting specific regions and utilizing existing and future programs to boost local economies.

## Key points

- **Focus on Economically Distressed Regions:** The order targets municipalities and regions meeting specific criteria such as being in a Community Disaster Resiliency Zone, a persistent poverty county, or participating in specific federal programs.
- **Place-Based Economic Development:** The order emphasizes policies and programs that focus on defined regions, including Tribal lands. It involves a coordinated approach that incorporates community input to improve infrastructure, workforce development, and economic opportunity.
- **Interagency Collaboration:** The order mandates interagency collaboration, with the Secretary of Commerce leading the effort to coordinate investments and policy recommendations for place-based economic development. Key agencies include the Departments of Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, HHS, HUD, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, EPA, and SBA.
- **Improved Access to Federal Resources:** The order seeks to improve access to federal resources by offering technical assistance, streamlining application processes, and ensuring that communities are aware of funding opportunities.

## Areas of Concern

- **Broad Definitions:** The definition of "covered communities" is broad, relying on multiple criteria which could lead to confusion or uneven application. This could result in certain communities being inadvertently excluded or favored.
- **Potential for Bureaucracy:** The order calls for a high level of interagency collaboration and the creation of a technical assistance network. This could potentially lead to increased bureaucracy and inefficiencies.
- **Reliance on Existing Programs:** While the order aims to increase accessibility to existing programs, there is a lack of specifics regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and whether they are truly adequate.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Federal Authority:** The order relies on the President's executive authority to direct federal agencies to implement its policies. The order does not expand any agency authority, but could increase agency administrative burden.
- **No New Funding:** The executive order specifies that the directives within are subject to the availability of appropriations. It does not create new financial obligations and is intended to be budget neutral through existing funds. There is a clause stating that the order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
- **Separation of Powers:** The order does not appear to encroach on the powers of other branches of the government. It largely focuses on how existing resources are utilized and coordinated within the executive branch.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Positive Economic Growth:** If implemented effectively, the order could lead to significant economic growth in distressed regions by attracting private investments and supporting workforce development.
- **Increased Community Engagement:** By requiring agencies to engage with local communities, the order could lead to a more effective allocation of resources and programs.
- **Improved Infrastructure:** The focus on physical infrastructure could lead to improved access to essential services and utilities in underserved areas.

Final Summary
This Executive Order is designed to help left-behind communities make a comeback by improving access to federal programs and resources, fostering economic growth, and promoting collaboration between agencies and communities. However, attention should be paid to the potential bureaucratic challenges and ensuring the effective and equitable distribution of resources.
