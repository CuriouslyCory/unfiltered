# Analysis of Organization of the National Security Council and Subcommittees

This document, titled National Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-1, outlines the organizational structure of the National Security Council (NSC) and its subcommittees. It details responsibilities, membership, and processes for policy development and decision-making related to national and homeland security.

## Key Points

- **NSC Structure:** The memorandum establishes the NSC as the primary body for advising the President on national security matters, incorporating both national and homeland security. It also defines the roles and responsibilities of the National Security Advisor and Homeland Security Advisor.
- **Committees:** It outlines the functions of the Principals Committee (PC) and Deputies Committee (DC) as key interagency forums for policy development and implementation.
- **Policy Coordination:** Policy Coordination Committees (PCCs) are designated to handle day-to-day interagency coordination and policy development at the Assistant Secretary level.
- **Decision-Making:** The memo details the procedures for agenda setting, dispute resolution, and referral of issues to higher levels of the NSC.
- **Membership and Attendees:** The document clearly defines members, attendees, and invitees for the NSC, PC, and DC, emphasizing inclusivity while maintaining necessary secrecy and efficiency.

## Areas of Concern

- **Concentration of Power:** The National Security Advisor and Homeland Security Advisor wield significant control over agenda setting and committee membership, potentially limiting diverse input.
- **Dispute Resolution:** The dispute resolution process, while defined, culminates in a decision by the White House Chief of Staff or Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, raising concerns about potential political influence over national security policy.
- **Executive Branch Discretion:** The discretionary powers of the advisors to determine attendees at meetings may be subject to potential abuse.
- **Revocation of Previous Directives:** The revocation of National Security Memorandum-2 indicates a potential shift in policy focus and priorities, which may require careful monitoring.

## Constitutional Considerations

- **Separation of Powers:** The memorandum primarily addresses the executive branch's internal organization but must still operate within the bounds of the separation of powers established in the Constitution. The NSC structure could impact the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.
- **Accountability and Transparency:** While the memorandum establishes processes for policy development and implementation, it does not explicitly address issues of public accountability or transparency. The lack of transparency could be a concern given the significant role of the NSC in national security matters.
- **Due Process:** While not directly applicable, the potential for biased or incomplete information to influence the decision-making process could indirectly affect the rights of individuals if it leads to policies that impact them. Specifically when making decisions that could impact peopleâ€™s rights, there is a need to ensure that all relevant information is considered and properly analyzed.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Increased Executive Control:** The organizational structure outlined in the memorandum could consolidate control over national security policy within the executive branch, potentially undermining checks and balances.
- **Policy Implementation:** The heavy reliance on PCCs may lead to a more structured approach to policy implementation, but could also potentially create bureaucratic hurdles.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The discretionary authority of the National Security Advisor and other key figures could be subject to abuse if not managed with integrity and accountability.
- **Shift in National Security Priorities:** The revocation of previous guidance may lead to a noticeable shift in the administration's national security priorities and strategies.

Final Summary
This executive order primarily focuses on structuring the internal organization of the executive branch for handling matters of national security, which in and of itself is not dangerous. However, the high degree of control granted to the National Security Advisor and their staff and lack of specific transparency mechanisms raises potential concerns about bias, lack of accountability and the potential for the abuse of power. The order will likely lead to more centralized control and oversight of national security policy and implementation.
