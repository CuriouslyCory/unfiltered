# Analysis of Executive Order—Withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, directs the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO).

## Key Points

- **Withdrawal from WHO:** The order officially retracts the U.S.'s rescission of its initial withdrawal notice from the WHO.
- **Justification:** The order cites WHO's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of reforms, and political influence from member states, along with the disproportionate financial burden placed on the U.S.
- **Revocation of Prior Order:** It revokes Executive Order 13987, which organized the U.S. government's COVID-19 response.
- **National Security Council Role:** The order tasks the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs with establishing new health and biosecurity structures within the NSC.
- **Financial Measures:** It directs the pause of U.S. funds to WHO, recall of U.S. personnel, and identification of alternative health partners.
- **Global Health Strategy Review:** The order mandates a review, rescission, and replacement of the 2024 U.S. Global Health Security Strategy.
- **Cessation of Negotiations:** The U.S. will halt negotiations on the WHO Pandemic Agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations.

## Areas of Concern

- **Disruption of Global Health Efforts:** The withdrawal could disrupt global health initiatives and collaboration.
- **Lack of Alternative Plan:** While the order aims to find alternate partners, the transition process may cause gaps in health security.
- **Unilateral Action:** The move may strain international relations and raise concerns about the U.S.'s commitment to global cooperation.
- **Potential Public Health Risks:** Disengaging from WHO may leave the U.S. less prepared for future pandemics and health threats.

## Constitutional Considerations

- **Presidential Authority:** The President's power to withdraw from international organizations is generally recognized, subject to the limits of treaty obligations and Congressional oversight.
- **Separation of Powers:** While the executive branch can negotiate and sign agreements, Congress has oversight over funding and treaty ratification. This order may create conflicts between these powers.
- **Impact on International Law:** The withdrawal could weaken the U.S.'s standing in international law and health diplomacy.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Weakened Pandemic Preparedness:** The withdrawal may leave the U.S. less prepared for future pandemics.
- **Strain on International Relations:** The order may alienate allies and weaken global health cooperation.
- **Gaps in Global Health Funding:** It might create a void in global health funding and technical support.
- **Reduced Global Health Influence:** It may diminish U.S. influence in shaping international health policies.

Final Summary: This Executive Order directs the United States' withdrawal from the WHO, citing concerns over the organization's performance and U.S. financial burden. While the order appears to fall under presidential authority, it raises significant concerns about the disruption of global health efforts, potential public health risks, and the ramifications for U.S. international relations.
