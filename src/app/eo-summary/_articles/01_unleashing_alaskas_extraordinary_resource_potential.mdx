# Analysis of Executive Order—Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential

This executive order, signed on January 20, 2025, aims to maximize the development of natural resources in Alaska by reversing previous restrictions and prioritizing resource extraction.

## Key points

- **Resource Development:** The order prioritizes the development of Alaska's natural resources including energy, minerals, timber, and seafood.
- **Expedited Permitting:** It calls for the expedited permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects in Alaska.
- **LNG Prioritization:** The order specifically highlights the development of Alaska's liquified natural gas (LNG) potential for both domestic and international sale.
- **Reversal of Prior Restrictions:** The order rescinds multiple regulations, orders, and guidance documents from the previous administration that restricted resource development.
- **Arctic National Wildlife Refuge:** The order withdraws Secretarial Order 3401 and reinstates previous decisions to allow oil and gas leasing within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
- **Road to King Cove:** The order facilitates the expedited development of a road corridor between the community of King Cove and the airport in Cold Bay.
- **Review of Waterways:** The order calls for a review of waterways to transfer ownership to the State and facilitate resource development.
- **Cultural Significance:** Directs the Department of Interior to consult with State agencies regarding subsistence and cultural hunting/fishing practices.
- **Military Coordination:** Calls for a collaboration between Secretary of Defense and other agencies to facilitate energy export and the long term use of Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
- **Transporation Infrastructure:** Directs the Secretary of Army to support the clearing and maintenance of transportation infrastructure requested by the Governor of Alaska.

## Areas of Concern

- **Environmental Impact:** The order could lead to significant environmental damage due to the accelerated pace of resource extraction and weakening of environmental regulations. Rescinding environmental protections in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other sensitive areas is particularly concerning.
- **Subsistence Practices:** The accelerated resource development could negatively affect the subsistence practices of indigenous communities in Alaska.
- **Tribal Consultation:** While the order directs consultation with the State of Alaska, the order gives little mention for the need to engage in nation-to-nation consultation with indigenous tribes and their governing bodies.
- **Climate Change:** Increased fossil fuel production from Alaska’s oil and gas reserves goes against current global efforts to mitigate climate change.
- **Legal Challenges:** The rescinding of numerous orders and regulations from the previous administration could lead to protracted legal battles.
- **Lack of Specificity:** The broad language of the order grants wide latitude to executive agencies, which could lead to unforeseen impacts.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The directive to 'rescind any agency action' that may hinder critical projects could be abused and used to bypass existing regulatory safeguards.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers:** The executive order may be viewed as exceeding presidential authority by overriding previous administrative actions and judicial precedents, potentially infringing on Congressional power and undermining the administrative rulemaking process. This may also violate checks and balances by weakening environmental regulatory safeguards.
- **Due Process:** The order may infringe on due process by rescinding previous agency actions without providing adequate public engagement or justification.
- **Takings Clause:** The order may also be problematic as it rescinds protections for designated public areas in order to expedite commercial activities. This may potentially lead to a “taking” without the necessary compensation for resources that are in the public domain.
- **Equal Protection:** The order could disproportionately affect indigenous Alaskans and their ability to use public resources to engage in traditional subsistence practices, potentially raising equal protection concerns under the 14th amendment.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Environmental Damage:** Irreversible damage to ecosystems and wildlife habitats, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.
- **Social and Cultural Impact:** Disruption of subsistence livelihoods and cultural heritage of indigenous communities in Alaska.
- **Legal Battles:** Numerous lawsuits and judicial challenges could delay or block the implementation of the order.
- **Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Increased production and burning of fossil fuels could worsen climate change.
- **Economic Instability:** Fluctuations in global energy markets could undermine the anticipated economic gains from resource development.
- **Diminished Public Input:** Undermining public engagement in public decisions could lead to an erosion of democracy and social discord.
- **Diminished Trust:** Undermining public trust in governmental actions by revoking previously agreed upon regulatory protections.

Final Summary:
This Executive Order presents significant constitutional and ethical concerns by prioritizing resource extraction over environmental and cultural preservation, and may violate the principles of separation of power and due process. Its implementation could have profound and potentially irreversible impacts on Alaska's environment, indigenous communities, and the global climate.
