# Analysis of Executive Order - Withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization

This Executive Order, signed on January 20, 2025, directs the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). It cites the WHO's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its failure to adopt reforms, and its alleged susceptibility to political influence as reasons for the withdrawal.

## Key points

-   **Withdrawal from WHO:** The order initiates the process of withdrawing the United States from the WHO, revoking the previous retraction of the withdrawal notice.
-   **Revocation of Previous Order:** Executive Order 13987 of January 25, 2021, which organized the US response to COVID-19, is revoked.
-   **National Security Council Role:** The order directs the establishment of directorates within the National Security Council to address public health and biosecurity.
-  **Financial and Personnel Actions:** The order mandates pausing US funding to the WHO, recalling US personnel, and identifying alternative partners for necessary activities.
-   **Global Health Strategy Review:** The order mandates a review, rescission, and replacement of the 2024 U.S. Global Health Security Strategy.
-   **Negotiation Cessation:** The order directs the cessation of negotiations on the WHO Pandemic Agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Global Health Coordination:** The withdrawal from the WHO could potentially hamper global efforts in pandemic response, disease surveillance, and overall public health coordination.
-   **Alternative Structures:** The need to establish new national structures may cause delays and inefficiencies in addressing global health issues.
-   **Financial Impact**:  Pausing U.S. funds could hamper the WHO's operations, especially in low-income countries.
-   **Diplomatic Ramifications**:  The withdrawal from the WHO can cause tension in the relationships with US allies who may not share the same sentiment.

## Constitutional Considerations:

-   **Presidential Authority:** The President has the authority to direct the executive branch on foreign policy decisions. However, the long-term implications of the decision would be subject to Congressional oversight and could be contested.
-   **Treaty Obligations:**  While the order refers to the withdrawal process, treaties with the UN and WHO may require specific procedures. It is not clear if the executive branch has the legal authority to terminate treaty obligations alone, or if that requires congress. 
-   **Congressional Oversight:** This action could raise questions about the separation of powers, especially if Congress is not fully in support of the move. 

**Potential Implications:**

-   **Reduced Global Health Leadership:** The withdrawal could diminish the U.S. role in global health leadership.
-   **Missed Opportunities:** Reduced access to WHO data, resources, and expertise might result in missed opportunities for early detection and response to health crises.
-   **Duplication of Efforts:** The need to find and fund alternative partners could result in inefficient duplication of resources and expertise.
-  **Loss of Influence:** By withdrawing, the US could lose influence over important international health regulations and standards. 

Final Summary
The Executive Order seeks to withdraw the United States from the WHO, citing concerns about the organization's performance and political influence. This action could have significant ramifications for global health cooperation, requiring careful monitoring and consideration of constitutional and legal limits.
