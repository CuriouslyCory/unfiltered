# Analysis of Executive Order—Partial Revocation of Executive Order 13961

This executive order, signed by Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on January 19, 2025, partially revokes Executive Order 13961, focusing on the governance and integration of federal mission resilience.

## Key points

- **Revocation of Sections:** The order revokes Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of Executive Order 13961.
- **Renumbering and Amendment:** Sections 2, 6, and 8 of Executive Order 13961 are renumbered, and Section 1 is amended to change "To achieve this policy, in conjunction" to "In conjunction".
- **Committee Replacement:** Section 2(b) is amended to replace the reference to "the Executive Committee established in section 3 of this order" with "the Restricted Principals Committee described in section 3 of the National Security Memorandum of January 19, 2025 (National Continuity Policy)".
- **General Provisions:** The order includes standard provisions stating that it doesn't affect existing legal authorities or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget, is subject to applicable law and appropriations, and does not create enforceable rights or benefits.

## Areas of Concern

- **Limited Scope:** The order is primarily administrative and focuses on restructuring existing executive orders, so its immediate impact and danger is minimal.
- **Dependency on National Security Memo:** The order references the National Security Memorandum of January 19, 2025, which was not provided, and understanding that document could be important for understanding the implication of the order.

## Constitutional Considerations

- **Executive Authority:** The President has the authority to issue executive orders and modify or revoke previous orders. This action falls within the president’s powers.
- **Separation of Powers:** This action primarily modifies internal executive branch operations and does not directly encroach on the powers of other branches.
- **Due Process:** The order doesn't directly impact individual rights and does not raise due process concerns. The standard clause prevents the order from creating any enforceable right.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Continuity of Governance:** By shifting the executive responsibility to the Restricted Principals Committee the order signals an intent to coordinate federal continuity policy at a high level.
- **Bureaucratic Efficiency:** The reorganization aims to clarify and streamline the lines of authority for federal mission resilience, potentially improving efficiency and coordination.

Final Summary
The executive order is primarily an administrative action to reorganize and streamline previous executive orders. It revokes, renumbers, and amends sections of Executive Order 13961, changing the authority of specific committees. There are no immediate constitutional issues or malicious intent but the full impact can not be determined without access to the National Security Memorandum referenced in the order.
