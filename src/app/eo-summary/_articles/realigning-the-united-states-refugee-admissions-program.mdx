# Analysis of Executive Order—Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program

TLDR; This executive order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, suspends the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) and mandates that state and local jurisdictions have more say in the placement of refugees. It also revokes a prior executive order by Biden.

## Key points

- **Suspension of USRAP**: The order suspends the USRAP due to the strain on American communities and resources from the recent increase in migrants.
- **State and Local Involvement**: It aims to give state and local jurisdictions more power over refugee placement, wherever legal.
- **Case-by-Case Exception**: The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis if doing so is in the national interest.
- **Revocation of Previous Order:** Executive Order 14013, which focused on rebuilding and enhancing programs to resettle refugees, is revoked.
- **Mandate for Review**: The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit reports every 90 days to assess if resuming the USRAP is in the best interests of the US.

## Areas of Concern

- **Potential for Discrimination:** The case-by-case exception could lead to biased decisions regarding refugee admissions.
- **Overreach of Executive Authority:** The suspension of a program like the USRAP could be viewed as an overreach of presidential power.
- **Lack of Clarity on Resumption Criteria**: The order does not specify what conditions must be met for the USRAP to resume, creating uncertainty.
- **Potential for violation of the INA**: While the order cites the INA as its legal basis, its actions may violate parts of the same statute.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers**: The executive order could face challenges based on the principle of separation of powers, as some may argue that refugee admissions are primarily a legislative function.
- **Due Process and Equal Protection**: The case-by-case exception could create a two-tiered system, raising concerns about due process and equal protection under the law.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Humanitarian Impact:** The suspension of the USRAP could leave many refugees in vulnerable situations.
- **Strain on International Relations**: The move could strain the United States' relations with international partners involved in refugee resettlement.
- **Increased Local Tension**: Increased local control could lead to tension and conflict over refugee placement.

Final Summary: This executive order suspends the USRAP, citing national interest, security, and local resource constraints. It seeks to give more power to state and local governments over refugee resettlement. While the stated aim is to ensure national security and well-being, the order has the potential to create discrimination, violate international commitments, and destabilize humanitarian efforts. It also raises questions about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.
