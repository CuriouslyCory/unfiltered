# Analysis of Executive Order—Restoring the Death Penalty and Protecting Public Safety

This executive order, signed on January 20, 2025, mandates the aggressive pursuit of the death penalty at the Federal level, seeks to overturn Supreme Court precedents that limit the death penalty, and prioritizes the prosecution of violent crime. It also targets those who it believes subvert capital punishment through the judicial system.

## Key Points

-   **Policy:** The order declares that it is the policy of the United States to ensure that laws authorizing capital punishment are respected and faithfully implemented, while counteracting those who obstruct its execution. 
-   **Federal Capital Punishment:** The Attorney General is directed to pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity that merits it, with special attention to the murder of a law enforcement officer and capital crimes committed by aliens illegally present in the US.
-   **State Capital Punishment:** The Attorney General is directed to encourage State attorneys general and district attorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes with special attention to the crimes of murder of a law enforcement officer and capital crimes committed by aliens illegally present in the US. The Attorney General must also ensure that states that allow capital punishment have sufficient drugs to carry out lethal injections, and must take all appropriate action to approve or deny any pending request for certification made by any State under 28 U.S.C. 2265.
-   **Overruling Precedents:** The order directs the Attorney General to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the imposition of capital punishment.
-   **Prosecuting Crime:** The order directs the Attorney General to prioritize public safety and the prosecution of violent crime, while working to dismantle transnational criminal activity.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Mandatory Death Penalty Pursuit:** The order mandates the Attorney General to seek the death penalty for broad categories of crime. This could lead to mandatory death penalty applications without consideration of mitigating factors, which violates legal norms. Also, the order could undermine due process and individual rights.
-   **Targeting of Judges:** The executive order explicitly criticizes judges who oppose capital punishment, accusing them of subverting the law. This could undermine the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. The order also targets actions taken by past administrations (Biden Administration). This rhetoric is concerning as it attacks the judicial and executive branches for applying discretion within the scope of the law.
-   **Targeting Immigrants:** The executive order singles out capital crimes committed by aliens illegally present in the country. This provision raises concerns about discrimination and prejudice based on immigration status.
-   **Overruling Supreme Court Precedents:** The order directs the Attorney General to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents limiting the death penalty. This could lead to a destabilization of established legal principles and is an overreach of executive power.
-   **Federal Overreach:** The order seeks to strongly influence state-level capital punishment policies, including influencing which cases are charged and securing drug supplies. This could be seen as an overreach of federal authority into state matters.

## Constitutional Considerations

-   **Eighth Amendment:** The order's stance on mandatory death penalty pursuit could violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by not allowing individual consideration of mitigating circumstances. This could lead to excessive punishment.
-   **Separation of Powers:** The order's explicit targeting of judges who oppose capital punishment infringes on the independence of the judiciary, thereby violating the principle of the separation of powers, as defined in Article III of the Constitution. Furthermore, the executive branch directing the judicial branch to reverse past Supreme Court precedents goes against the established principles of judicial review.
-   **Equal Protection:** The order's singling out of crimes by undocumented immigrants risks violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This clause demands that all persons be treated similarly under law.
-   **Federalism:** The order's overreach into state-level matters, particularly regarding capital punishment policies, infringes on principles of federalism, undermining the state's power.

## Potential Implications

-   **Erosion of Civil Liberties:** The order could lead to a broad expansion of the application of the death penalty, impacting civil liberties and due process rights. It could also lead to the execution of innocent individuals or individuals who are mentally impaired.
-   **Destabilization of Legal Norms:** Overturning existing Supreme Court precedents could create legal chaos and uncertainty, undermining legal stability and precedent.
-   **Increased Litigation:** The aggressive pursuit of the death penalty will likely lead to increased litigation, both on an individual and a systemic level. This is especially true regarding state capital punishment laws and procedures.
-   **Social Division:** The order’s targeting of immigrants and criticism of judges could further deepen societal divisions. This is also especially true for policies that are generally unpopular and have strong public opposition.

Final Summary

This executive order represents a radical departure from established legal norms. It risks undermining individual rights, due process, and the independence of the judiciary. It also could lead to widespread social unrest and legal instability. The overreach of executive power, combined with the targeting of judges and immigrants, raises grave concerns about the order's constitutionality and potential impact on society.
