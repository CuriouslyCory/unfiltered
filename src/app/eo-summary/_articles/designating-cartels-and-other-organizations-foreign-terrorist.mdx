# Analysis of Executive Order—Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists

TLDR; This executive order directs the designation of certain international cartels and transnational organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists.

## Key points

- **Designation of Cartels:** The order aims to designate international cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).
- **National Security Threat:** It declares cartels a national security threat due to their convergence with terrorist groups, engagement in asymmetric warfare, and infiltration of foreign governments.
- **Transnational Organizations:** It includes other transnational organizations such as Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) as similar threats.
- **National Emergency:** A national emergency is declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
- **Policy Aim:** The policy goal is the total elimination of these organizations' presence in the US and their ability to threaten the country.
- **Implementation:** Directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with other relevant departments, to make recommendations for FTO/SDGT designations. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are also ordered to prepare to implement the Alien Enemies Act.

## Areas of Concern

- **Broad Definitions:** The order uses broad and potentially vague language, which could lead to the overreach of power and abuse.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The designation of cartels and other groups as terrorist organizations may lead to the abuse of power and the infringement of rights.
- **Use of Emergency Powers:** The declaration of a national emergency may be seen as excessive and could lead to a shift in executive power.
- **Alien Enemies Act:** The order directs preparations for the implementation of the Alien Enemies Act, which could have severe implications for immigrants or foreign nationals residing in the US.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers:** The order may impinge on Congress's role in defining and regulating terrorism.
- **Due Process:** The use of the Alien Enemies Act must be consistent with principles of due process and fair treatment of non-citizens.
- **Executive Overreach:** The broad use of executive power to designate groups as terrorist organizations is questionable.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Increased Law Enforcement:** May lead to increased law enforcement actions and surveillance of targeted groups.
- **Border Security:** May lead to changes to policy and procedure at border entry points.
- **Civil Liberties:** The designation of these groups as terrorist organizations could lead to violations of civil liberties and rights of people who may be misidentified or swept up in the enforcement actions.
- **Foreign Relations:** The designation of foreign organizations may strain relations with some countries.

Final Summary
This executive order attempts to address the perceived national security threat posed by international cartels and transnational organizations. However, its broad language, potential for abuse, and possible infringement on civil liberties raise serious concerns about its constitutional validity and practical impact.
