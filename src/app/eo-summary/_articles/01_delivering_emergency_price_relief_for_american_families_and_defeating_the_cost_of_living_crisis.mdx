# Analysis of Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis

This executive order, signed on January 20, 2025, directs executive departments and agencies to take actions to provide emergency price relief to the American people. The order is predicated on the idea that the previous administration's policies caused a cost-of-living crisis, which the new administration aims to alleviate.

## Key points

- **Focus:** The order is aimed at lowering costs of housing, healthcare, and other essential goods and services.
- **Economic Philosophy:** The order attributes high prices to the policies of the Biden Administration, particularly its spending, regulatory burdens, and climate policies.
- **Specific Actions:** The order directs agencies to reduce costs associated with housing, healthcare, home appliances, and energy, and to foster job growth.
- **Regulatory Reduction:** The order seeks to eliminate counterproductive requirements that raise the costs of various goods and services.
- **Reporting:** The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy is tasked to report on the implementation of the order every 30 days.

## Areas of Concern

- **Causal Attribution:** The order directly blames the previous administration for the current cost-of-living crisis. It is unlikely that every point can be directly and singularly attributed to the last administration.
- **Vague Directives:** The order gives very broad directives. Terms such as "unnecessary administrative expenses," "counterproductive requirements," and "harmful, coercive climate policies" lack specificity. This might lead to arbitrary actions.
- **Potential for Overreach:** The broad mandate may allow for actions that go beyond the scope of executive authority.
- **Reliance on Unsubstantiated Claims:** Some claims within the document lack specific supporting evidence.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers:** The order potentially infringes upon Congressional powers. The order directs agencies to take actions, but some might require legislative action.
- **Administrative Law:** The order could face challenges if the changes are not consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. Any changes to regulations should follow proper procedures of notice and comment.
- **Due Process:** It is important that any implementation of these directives are carried out fairly and without undue harm to existing programs.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Regulatory Instability:** The order may lead to regulatory instability, potentially harming certain markets and industries.
- **Legal Challenges:** The actions taken under this order may lead to legal challenges based on overreach and procedural concerns.
- **Economic Uncertainty:** Aggressive and rapid changes could create economic uncertainty that further drives up prices.

Final Summary
The Executive Order seeks to address the cost of living crisis and suggests several broad actions. While the aim is laudable, the sweeping nature and lack of specificity raise concerns about potential overreach, legal challenges, and unintended consequences.
