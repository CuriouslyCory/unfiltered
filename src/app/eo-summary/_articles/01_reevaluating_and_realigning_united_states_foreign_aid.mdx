# Analysis of Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid

This Executive Order, signed on January 20, 2025, mandates a 90-day pause on new foreign development assistance obligations and disbursements. It calls for a review of all foreign aid programs to ensure alignment with U.S. foreign policy and provides a mechanism for resuming, modifying, or ceasing these programs. The order gives significant power to the Secretary of State and Director of the OMB.

## Key Points

-   **90-Day Pause:** All new obligations and disbursements of foreign development assistance are paused for 90 days.
-   **Program Review:** All foreign assistance programs will be reviewed for efficiency and consistency with U.S. foreign policy.
-  **Secretary of State Approval**: The Secretary of State has the authority to approve or disapprove the continuation of foreign aid programs based on the results of the reviews.
-   **OMB Enforcement**: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will enforce the pause through its apportionment authority.
- **Waiver**: The Secretary of State has the authority to waive the pause.

## Areas of Concern

-   **Vague Alignment Criteria:** The order states that aid must align with the President's foreign policy without clearly defining what this entails. This lack of specificity could lead to arbitrary decisions and could be used to stop aid based on political reasons.
-   **Concentration of Power:** The order gives significant decision-making authority to the Secretary of State and the Director of the OMB, potentially bypassing established oversight mechanisms.
-   **Potential for Disruption:** A 90-day pause could cause significant disruptions to ongoing projects, especially in countries dependent on the aid for public safety and health reasons.

## Constitutional Considerations:

-   **Congressional Power of the Purse:** The Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, meaning they control government spending. The executive order could be interpreted as an attempt to redirect or impede spending previously authorized by Congress.
-   **Separation of Powers:** While the President has broad authority in foreign policy, this order may blur the line between executive and legislative powers, especially regarding spending.

**Potential Implications:**

-   **Disruption of Aid Programs:** A 90-day pause could severely disrupt ongoing and planned foreign development projects and undermine US relationships with affected countries.
-   **Reduced Humanitarian Assistance:** The pause might limit the ability of the U.S. to respond to crises or emergencies as it occurs.
-   **Erosion of Trust:**  Halting aid could be viewed as unreliable by partner nations.
-   **Political Influence**: The order may be used as a tool for imposing U.S. political and ideological viewpoints on foreign countries, and can be used to favor or disfavor certain groups.

Final Summary
This executive order introduces a significant shift in how the US delivers foreign aid, potentially undermining existing obligations and Congressional intent. The language within the order grants a large amount of power to the executive branch, which could lead to arbitrary decisions. The order may face legal challenges based on separation of powers and the Congressional authority to control spending. The order may not be in the best interest of world stability and may harm U.S. relationships.
