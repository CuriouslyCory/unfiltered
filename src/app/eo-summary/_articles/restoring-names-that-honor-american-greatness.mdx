# Analysis of Executive Order—Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness

TLDR; This executive order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, seeks to rename certain geographical features, particularly Mount McKinley back to its original name and to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, while also reconstituting the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

## Key points

- **Renaming of Mount McKinley**: Directs the Secretary of the Interior to reinstate the name "Mount McKinley" for North America's highest peak, reversing a 2015 decision by President Obama. It also instructs the Secretary to update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) accordingly.
- **Renaming of Gulf of Mexico**: Renames the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America," citing its importance to the American economy, maritime industry, and history. The order instructs the Secretary of the Interior to take appropriate actions to rename and remove references to the Gulf of Mexico in GNIS.
- **Reconstitution of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names**: Requires agency heads to review and potentially replace their appointees on the U.S. Board on Geographic Names within seven days. It also empowers the Secretary of the Interior to make additional appointments. The Board is directed to advance the policy of honoring "visionary and patriotic Americans" and may update its principles and policies to achieve this policy.
- **Public and Intergovernmental Input**: The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor.

## Areas of Concern

- **Potential for Politicization**: The order emphasizes honoring "visionary and patriotic Americans," which is vague and open to political interpretation. This could lead to the renaming of landmarks based on political ideologies rather than historical or cultural significance.
- **Disregard of Native American Heritage**: While the order acknowledges working with Alaska Native entities on some landmarks, the renaming of Mount McKinley back to the name, despite the known local historical name of Denali, and the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico does not appear to recognize the historical and cultural significance for Indigenous peoples.
- **Centralization of Power**: The executive order grants significant power to the Secretary of the Interior and the newly constituted Board, potentially undermining local and community-based naming conventions. The order also requires changes to names be implemented across the entire federal government which could be costly.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Executive Authority**: While the President has authority over federal nomenclature and the management of government properties, the extent to which this authority can be used to reverse previous naming decisions and impose new names is debatable, especially when those decisions were in line with existing laws and procedures.
- **Separation of Powers**: While the order does not directly violate the separation of powers, the broad power granted to the Secretary of Interior in this area and the ability of this board to supersede local naming conventions could encroach on areas that have historically been left to more decentralized processes.
- **First Amendment Implications**: The emphasis on “patriotic” Americans could open the door to discrimination based on viewpoints or beliefs, raising First Amendment concerns.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Public Outcry and Legal Challenges**: The renaming of culturally significant landmarks, particularly without broad community consultation, is likely to generate strong opposition and could lead to legal challenges.
- **Bureaucratic Inefficiency**: The order could lead to administrative chaos and inefficiencies as federal agencies scramble to update maps, contracts, and other documents to reflect the changes.
- **Erosion of Trust**: The politicization of geographic names could erode public trust in government and lead to further political divisions.

Final Summary
This executive order is a power grab to control geographic naming, and has far reaching implications for how US history is remembered. The order is likely to generate strong resistance, may prove to be unconstitutional, and could undermine public trust.
