# Analysis of Executive Order—Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, aims to restore names of geographic features and landmarks to honor what the order defines as "visionary and patriotic Americans."

## Key points

- **Reconstitutes the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (Board):** Directs agency heads to review and potentially replace their appointees to the Board and for the Secretary of the Interior to consider additional appointments.
- **Prioritizes honoring "visionary and patriotic Americans":** Directs the Board to update its policies to prioritize this goal when considering names and renames.
- **Renames Mount McKinley to Mount McKinley:** Mandates the Secretary of the Interior to reinstate the name Mount McKinley, while maintaining the name Denali National Park and Preserve.
- **Renames the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America:** Directs the Secretary of the Interior to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, updating all relevant federal systems and documents.
- **Seeks Additional Suggestions:** The Secretary of Interior may solicit additional patriots to honor.

## Areas of Concern

- **Subjectivity of "visionary and patriotic Americans":** The term "visionary and patriotic Americans" is subjective and opens the door to political bias in naming decisions, potentially excluding diverse perspectives and histories. This lack of clear criteria could lead to the erasure of important cultural heritage and create public controversy.
- **Reversal of Mount McKinley Name:** The reinstatement of Mount McKinley over Denali disregards the deep cultural significance and historic importance the name "Denali" holds for the indigenous people of Alaska. This action shows disrespect for indigenous history and culture.
- **Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America:** Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, while emphasizing its importance to the US, appears to disregard the historical and cultural significance the name 'Gulf of Mexico' holds for other nations and peoples who border it. This could be viewed as nationalistic overreach and disregarding historical context.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Potential Violation of First Amendment:** The subjective criteria for naming could be seen as a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment if the selection process demonstrably favors particular ideologies or political viewpoints.
- **Separation of Powers:** While the President has the power to issue executive orders, the extensive reshaping of the Board and the renaming of geographical features could be seen as an overreach into powers traditionally held by other branches of government. The directive to federal agencies to use the board-approved name "in the interim" may overstep the executive branch's authority.
- **Due Process Concerns:** The lack of clear guidelines for selecting and replacing board members may violate the due process rights of those who have served in good standing, especially if done solely for the political priorities laid out in the order.

## Potential Implications:

- **Political Polarization:** The order could further polarize public discourse by imposing politically charged naming decisions and potentially causing resentment among those who disagree.
- **Erosion of Indigenous Rights and Culture:** The erasure of the name Denali to McKinley is an erasure of Indigenous culture and history.
- **International Tensions:** Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to "Gulf of America" could lead to international diplomatic issues with neighboring countries and be seen as an imperialistic action, especially given the shared waters.
- **Challenges to Implementation:** Given the subjective nature of the naming criteria and the potential for legal challenges, the implementation of this order could be contentious and face significant roadblocks.
- **Erosion of Public Trust**: Politicizing geographic names could erode public trust in the government.

## Final Summary

The Executive Order seeks to rename and reconstitute the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to prioritize honoring what the order defines as "visionary and patriotic Americans," as well as renaming Mount McKinley and the Gulf of Mexico. However, the order's subjective criteria, disregard for Indigenous history, and potential for political bias raise serious constitutional, ethical, and practical concerns. The order could lead to increased political polarization, international tensions, and a potential erosion of public trust. The changes also may be a violation of separation of powers and the establishment clause.
