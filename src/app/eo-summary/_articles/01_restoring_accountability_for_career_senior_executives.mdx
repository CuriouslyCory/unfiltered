# Analysis of Executive Orderâ€”Restoring Accountability for Career Senior Executives

TLDR; This executive order aims to increase the accountability of Senior Executive Service (SES) officials by giving the President more direct control over their performance and roles.

## Key Points

- **Presidential Authority:** Reaffirms the President's authority over the Executive Branch and the need for SES officials to be accountable to the President.
- **SES Performance Plans:** Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue SES Performance Plans for agencies to adopt within 30 days.
- **Reassignment of SES Members:** Allows agency heads to reassign SES members to align their skills and mission assignments with the President's agenda.
- **Executive Resources Board (ERB) Changes:** Mandates termination of existing ERBs and the creation of new boards with senior noncareer officials as the majority.
- **Performance Review Board Changes:** Requires reconstitution of Performance Review Boards with members committed to strict enforcement of SES performance evaluations.
- **Removal Authority:** Agency heads are directed to take action, including removal, against SES officials who don't align with the order's principles or their duties.

## Areas of Concern

- **Politicization of Career Positions:** The order's emphasis on aligning SES officials with the President's agenda may politicize career civil service positions, potentially undermining their independence.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The broad authority to reassign and remove SES officials could be abused for political purposes, leading to a loss of expertise and instability within the federal workforce.
- **Undermining Merit System Principles:** The changes to the ERB and Performance Review Board could undermine the merit system principles that are designed to ensure fair and objective evaluation of career officials.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Executive Power:** The order asserts the President's executive power under Article II of the Constitution, which has been confirmed by the Supreme Court to include the power to remove subordinates. However, the potential for abuse of this power to replace qualified career professionals with political appointees raises concerns about its appropriate implementation.
- **Separation of Powers:** While the president has the power to oversee executive agencies, the order may upset the delicate balance of power if it leads to undue influence from the Executive over career professionals that are meant to be a check on the administration.
- **Due Process:** While the order references procedural requirements for reassigning and removing SES, there is a concern whether these offer adequate protections against arbitrary removals.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Reduced Morale:** The order may lead to reduced morale and increased turnover among career SES officials, who may feel insecure about their positions and the future of their careers.
- **Loss of Expertise:** The reassignment and removal of experienced SES officials may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, which could hinder the effectiveness of federal agencies.
- **Erosion of Public Trust:** The politicization of civil service positions could erode public trust in the federal government and its ability to administer programs fairly and impartially.

Final Summary
This executive order seeks to increase the accountability of Senior Executive Service (SES) officials by enhancing the President's direct control over their roles, performance reviews, and career paths. It raises significant concerns about the potential for political abuse, the erosion of the merit system, and the loss of institutional expertise within the federal workforce. While rooted in the concept of the President's executive authority, the order could lead to serious adverse consequences for the impartiality and effectiveness of the civil service.
