# Analysis of Executive Order—Securing Our Borders

This Executive Order, signed on January 20, 2025, by the President, aims to secure U.S. borders by constructing barriers, deploying personnel, detaining and removing illegal aliens, and resuming Migrant Protection Protocols. The order also prioritizes the prosecution of offenses related to border security.

## Key Points:

- **Border Security Measures:** Includes building physical barriers, deploying personnel, and utilizing technology for monitoring.
- **Detention and Removal:** Emphasizes detaining aliens apprehended for violating immigration law until their removal, terminating "catch-and-release" policies.
- **Migrant Protection Protocols:** Resumes the policy of returning aliens to the territory from which they came, pending removal proceedings.
- **Parole Policy Adjustments:** Stops using the CBP One app for parole, terminates categorical parole programs, and aligns all policies with the order.
- **International Cooperation:** Seeks international cooperation and agreements for handling illegal aliens.
- **DNA and Identification:** Mandates DNA collection for all detained aliens and uses technology to verify family relationships.
- **Prosecution of Offenses:** Prioritizes prosecution of human smuggling, human trafficking, child trafficking, and sex trafficking.

## Areas of Concern:

- **Broad Definition of "Illegal Aliens":** The term “illegal aliens” is used in the executive order and can be deemed derogatory and inhumane.
- **Potential for Overreach:** The order gives broad powers to executive agencies to implement changes and detain individuals, with minimal oversight.
- **Questionable Legality of Detentions:**  The order mandates detaining aliens until their removal, potentially leading to prolonged detentions that may violate due process.
- **Suspension of Parole:** The immediate suspension of the CBP One app and other categorical parole programs could lead to chaos at the border.
- **International Law Concerns:** Return of asylum seekers to potentially unsafe territories may violate international law.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Due Process:** The order might infringe on the due process rights of migrants if implemented without proper legal safeguards and cause inhumane and unjust conditions.
- **Separation of Powers:** Congress has the power over immigration law, and the executive action could overstep these boundaries.
- **Potential Violations of International Agreements:** The United States is party to international conventions, such as the Refugee Convention, that would need to be accounted for.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Increased Legal Challenges:** The policies of this order are highly likely to face lawsuits for violating due process and other constitutionally protected rights.
- **Humanitarian Crisis:**  The measures may worsen the conditions for migrants, creating a crisis situation at the border.
- **Strained International Relations:** The policy to send asylum seekers back to their country could create tension with international partners.
- **Economic Impact:** Deployment of resources, construction of barriers, and increased detention could significantly increase government spending.

Final Summary

The executive order attempts to create a hardline stance on immigration. However, there are numerous concerns relating to potential overreach, violations of due process, international legal obligations, and long-term humanitarian impact that may arise if this order is implemented.
