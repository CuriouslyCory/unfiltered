# Analysis of The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal (Global Tax Deal)

This executive memorandum, issued on January 20, 2025, addresses concerns regarding the OECD Global Tax Deal, stating that it has no force or effect in the United States without congressional approval.

## Key points

- **Rejection of Global Tax Deal:** The memorandum declares that the OECD Global Tax Deal, as agreed upon by the previous administration, has no legal effect within the U.S. without an act of Congress.
- **Notification to OECD:** The Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. Representative to the OECD are directed to inform the OECD that the U.S. does not recognize the prior commitments.
- **Investigation of Foreign Tax Practices:** The Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. Trade Representative are to investigate discriminatory or extraterritorial tax practices by other countries that affect American companies.
- **Options for Protective Measures:** The memorandum directs the development of options for protective measures against countries with such tax practices.

## Areas of Concern

- **Unilateral Action:** The memorandum asserts U.S. sovereignty in tax policy, potentially straining international cooperation and agreements on global tax rules.
- **Retaliatory Measures:** The directive to investigate foreign tax practices and develop protective measures could escalate international trade tensions and lead to retaliatory tax policies from other countries.
- **Lack of Congressional Input:** By unilaterally disavowing the Global Tax Deal, the executive branch risks overstepping its constitutional authority and bypassing legislative input on international trade and tax matters.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Treaty Power:** The memorandum's assertion that prior international agreements are void without Congressional action raises questions about the treaty-making power of the U.S. government and the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.
- **Commerce Clause:** While the federal government has broad power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, such regulations must be consistent with the Constitution and international obligations.
- **Congressional Authority:** Tax policy falls under the purview of Congress, and the executive branch's attempt to unilaterally nullify existing international agreements might be seen as an encroachment on congressional power.

**Potential Implications:**

- **International Trade Tensions:** Rejection of the Global Tax Deal and retaliatory measures may provoke international trade disputes and harm relations with trading partners.
- **Economic Impact:** Unpredictability in international tax policy could negatively impact American companies operating abroad and global investment.
- **Loss of International Influence:** Unilateral actions may diminish the U.S.'s ability to influence international tax policies.

Final Summary

The executive memorandum aims to invalidate prior U.S. commitments to the OECD Global Tax Deal, asserting national sovereignty over tax policy. It instructs the Treasury to investigate foreign tax practices that may affect American companies. However, this approach raises constitutional questions about treaty obligations and separation of powers, with potential international and economic repercussions.
