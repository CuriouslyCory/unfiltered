# Analysis of Putting People over Fish: Stopping Radical Environmentalism to Provide Water to Southern California

This memorandum, signed on January 20, 2025, directs the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of the Interior to prioritize water delivery to Southern California by restarting previous administration efforts to route water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

## Key points

- **Directs Water Rerouting:** The order mandates that the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall reroute water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California, prioritizing human use over environmental concerns.
- **Reimplementation of Previous Plans:** The order seeks to restart efforts from a prior Trump administration, which were allegedly halted by the State of California due to environmental protections.
- **Justification:** The order justifies rerouting water, citing the need for water to address wildfires in Southern California.
- **Reporting Requirement:** The Secretaries are required to report on implementation progress within 90 days.

## Areas of Concern

- **Environmental Impact:** The order raises concerns about the environmental impact of reducing water flow to the Delta, potentially harming the ecosystem and species like the Delta smelt mentioned in the memo.
- **Use of Terminology:** The language used frames environmental concerns as "radical environmentalism," possibly downplaying the importance of environmental protection and conservation.
- **Potential Legal Challenges:** It's possible that environmental groups may challenge the implementation of the order.
- **State-Federal Conflict:** The order may exacerbate existing tensions between the federal government and the State of California over water rights and environmental regulations.

## Constitutional Considerations

- **Federal Authority:** The order may test the extent of federal authority over water resources, particularly when state and environmental laws are in place.
- **Endangered Species Act:** Actions that may harm endangered species in the Delta could violate the Endangered Species Act.
- **Administrative Procedure Act:** The directive may need to follow procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act, requiring notice and comment on any changes to water management policies.

**Potential Implications**

- **Ecological Damage:** Reduced water flow may further damage the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem.
- **Legal Battles:** This order will likely face legal challenges from environmental groups and the State of California.
- **Interstate Water Disputes:** This may spark conflicts over water rights between different areas within California.

Final Summary
This Executive Order seeks to reroute water from Northern California to Southern California, characterizing this action as "Putting People over Fish". The order emphasizes the need for water in the southern region of the state, while also downplaying the importance of environmental protections in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. The order is likely to face legal and environmental challenges, given prior conflicts between California and the prior Trump administration over water rights.
