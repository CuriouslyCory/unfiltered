# Analysis of Executive Order—Providing for the Appointment of Alumni of AmeriCorps to the Competitive Service

This executive order, signed by Joseph R. Biden, Jr., on January 16, 2025, establishes a policy to grant non-competitive eligibility for certain positions in the Federal civil service to alumni of AmeriCorps programs.

## Key Points

- **Non-Competitive Eligibility:** Allows heads of executive departments or agencies to non-competitively appoint AmeriCorps alumni to competitive service positions.
- **Certification Requirement:** The CEO of AmeriCorps will issue certifications to individuals who have completed a full-time term of national service of at least 1,700 hours as a Team Leader or Member or have completed at least 1,700 hours under other AmeriCorps programs.
- **Time Limit for Appointment:** Appointments must be made within 1 year of completing service, with potential extensions up to 3 years for those in continued service, military service, higher education, or other activities.
- **Disqualifications:** Standard disqualifications for competitive service appointments also apply to appointments under this order.
- **OPM Authority:** The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is authorized to issue regulations to implement the order.

## Areas of Concern

- **Potential for Bias:** While the order aims to leverage the skills of AmeriCorps alumni, it could potentially create bias in hiring practices, overlooking other equally qualified candidates outside of the AmeriCorps program.
- **Impact on Merit System:** The move towards non-competitive hiring may undermine the merit-based system of the competitive service, raising concerns about fairness and effectiveness in government hiring.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Presidential Authority:** The order is issued under the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, specifically sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code. These sections grant the President some authority over hiring practices in the federal government, but this may be subject to judicial review.
- **Equal Opportunity:** While the order specifies that appointments shall not contravene existing laws, the preference to a specific pool of applicants may raise questions of equality under the law if other equally well qualified applicants are disadvantaged.
- **Separation of Powers:** It is important that Congress retains the ultimate authority to legislate matters concerning employment in the civil service, which will need to be reviewed if this executive order is to stand.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Increased Public Service:** This could incentivize individuals to join and complete AmeriCorps programs, providing a boost to public service initiatives.
- **Workforce Enhancement:** The program may bring a pool of experienced, service-oriented individuals into federal agencies and departments, benefiting their missions and effectiveness.
- **Potential Unintended Consequences:** Favoring a specific group over the general population, may result in unforeseen issues including resentment from candidates not in the program.

Final Summary
This executive order seeks to streamline the hiring process for AmeriCorps alumni by providing a non-competitive pathway into the competitive service. While it aims to enhance the federal workforce with skilled individuals, it raises concerns about potential bias, undermining the merit system, and the possibility of unintended consequences. The order's constitutionality is within the purview of the president but may be challenged.
