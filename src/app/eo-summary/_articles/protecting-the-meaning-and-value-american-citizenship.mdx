# Analysis of Executive Order—Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, seeks to redefine birthright citizenship, limiting it for certain individuals born in the U.S. It focuses on cases where the mother's presence is unlawful or temporary and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

## Key Points:

- **Redefining Birthright Citizenship:** It claims the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't automatically grant citizenship to everyone born in the U.S.
- **Exclusions:** Citizenship is not automatically extended to those born in the U.S. if (1) their mother was unlawfully present and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, or (2) the mother's presence was lawful but temporary, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.
- **Policy Directive:** No federal agency should issue documents recognizing citizenship or accept documents from state/local authorities recognizing citizenship for the excluded groups.
- **Implementation:** The order applies to those born 30 days after its issuance. Does not impact lawful permanent resident's children.
- **Enforcement:** Various secretaries and the Social Security Commissioner are directed to ensure regulations align with the order.

## Areas of Concern:

- **Constitutional Challenge:** The executive order directly challenges the established interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, potentially leading to legal challenges.
- **Discrimination:** The order appears to target and discriminate against children of undocumented immigrants and individuals on temporary visas.
- **Bureaucratic Burden:** Government agencies would need to re-evaluate how citizenship documents are handled for impacted populations.
