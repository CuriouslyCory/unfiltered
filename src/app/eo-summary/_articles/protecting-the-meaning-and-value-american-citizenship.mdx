# Executive Order—Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship

This Executive Order seeks to redefine birthright citizenship, limiting it for children born in the United States to parents who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents and whose mothers are either unlawfully present or are in the U.S. on a temporary basis.

**Key Points:**

- **Redefinition of "Subject to the Jurisdiction Thereof":** The order interprets the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in the Fourteenth Amendment to exclude individuals whose parents are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents at the time of their birth in the US and whose mothers were unlawfully present or were in the U.S. temporarily.
- **Exclusion from Automatic Citizenship:** The order states that individuals born in the U.S. will not automatically be recognized as citizens if their mother was unlawfully present, and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, or if their mother was in the U.S. on a temporary basis (such as a tourist or student visa), and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.
- **Prospective Application:** The order applies only to individuals born in the U.S. 30 days after the date of the order.
- **Directive to Agencies:** Federal agencies are instructed to revise policies to ensure they do not issue documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to individuals who meet the order's criteria.
- **Enforcement Measures:** The Secretaries of State, Homeland Security, and the Attorney General are instructed to take measures to align their agencies with this order.

**Areas of Concern:**

- **Conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment:** The order's reinterpretation of "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" directly challenges the established understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause, which generally grants citizenship to all persons born within U.S. territory, subject to very narrow exceptions. This may be viewed as a clear attempt to undermine the 14th amendment.
- **Potential for Legal Challenges:** The order is highly likely to face immediate and significant legal challenges based on constitutional grounds, including potential violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause.
- **Impact on Families and Children:** The order's implementation would have profound implications for families and children born in the United States, creating a class of individuals who are not recognized as U.S. citizens, despite being born within U.S. borders.
- **Administrative and Logistical Challenges:** The order will be difficult to implement and will likely require significant changes in how federal agencies operate and process citizenship applications, birth certificates and other official documentation.
- **Discriminatory Implications:** The order appears to be aimed at children of immigrants and could result in discrimination based on immigration status.

**Constitutional Considerations:**

- **Fourteenth Amendment (Citizenship Clause):** The order's core argument that certain individuals born within U.S. territory are not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" is inconsistent with the prevailing interpretation of the Citizenship Clause. While there is some debate around the meaning of the clause, most scholars agree that it grants citizenship to nearly all persons born within the U.S., except those who are born to a foreign diplomat.
- **Equal Protection Clause (14th Amendment):** The order could be seen as discriminatory, potentially violating the Equal Protection Clause by creating classifications based on the immigration status of parents.
- **Fifth Amendment (Due Process):** Denying citizenship status without a judicial hearing may raise due process concerns.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Legal Battles:** The order is almost certain to be challenged in federal courts, potentially leading to a long and complex legal battle.
- **Uncertainty and Confusion:** The order's implementation will likely create uncertainty and confusion for families, government agencies, and the public.
- **Social and Ethical Concerns:** The order will undoubtedly spark significant social and ethical debate about the meaning of citizenship and the rights of individuals born within U.S. borders.
- **International Implications:** The order could raise concerns among international human rights organizations and other nations.

In summary, this Executive Order attempts a fundamental reinterpretation of birthright citizenship, challenging long-standing constitutional principles and the established understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment. The order is highly controversial, likely unconstitutional, and would create significant legal, social, and ethical challenges. The attempt to unilaterally change the Citizenship Clause through executive order is a significant departure from accepted legal norms and constitutional interpretation.
