# Analysis of Executive Order—Unleashing American Energy

This Executive Order, signed by Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, aims to prioritize domestic energy production, reduce regulations, and eliminate policies that support renewable energy and electric vehicles.

## Key Points

- **Promotes Energy Independence:** The order seeks to unleash domestic energy resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy, to meet the needs of the country.
- **Eliminates EV Mandates:** The order aims to eliminate electric vehicle mandates and promote consumer choice in vehicles.
- **Reverses Environmental Policies:** It revokes multiple executive orders related to climate change and environmental protection, including those from the previous administration.
- **Streamlines Permitting:** The order directs agencies to expedite and simplify the permitting process for energy projects.
- **Prioritizes Cost-Effectiveness:** The order prioritizes cost-effectiveness, American workers, and businesses in procurement and funding decisions.
- **Reevaluates Mineral Policy**: The order directs reevaluation of policy on domestic mining of non-fuel minerals, including critical minerals and uranium.

## Areas of Concern

- **Undermining Climate Action:** Revoking climate change-related executive orders and disbanding the IWG could hinder efforts to address climate change.
- **Environmental Impacts:** The emphasis on deregulation may lead to increased environmental damage, including water and air pollution.
- **Conflicts of Interest:** By prioritizing cost-effectiveness the order could lead to a disregard for health safety and long term environmental protections.
- **Judicial Review:** The order attempts to streamline and expedite federal permitting processes which could limit public input and judicial reviews of projects.
- **Disregard for Scientific Evidence:** The order seems to dismiss the scientific consensus on climate change and the importance of renewable energy.
- **Questionable Economic Strategy:** The order favors older energy sources over newer technologies potentially stifling progress in the long term.

## Constitutional Considerations:

- **Separation of Powers:** Some provisions, such as directing the Attorney General to seek stays in litigation, could be seen as overstepping executive authority and interfering with the judicial branch.
- **Regulatory Rollbacks:** The revocation of various executive orders and regulations may be subject to legal challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act, as agencies must follow proper procedures when issuing new rules.
- **Endangerment Findings**: The order calls into question the legality of the EPA administrator's findings, which is based on the Clean Air Act. These findings are a pillar of EPA regulation of greenhouse gasses.

**Potential Implications:**

- **Increased Pollution:** Reduced environmental regulation could lead to a rise in air and water pollution, negatively impacting public health.
- **Economic Instability:** The shift away from renewable energy could hinder long-term economic stability, with investments moving to other countries that are more focused on new energy sources.
- **National Security:** Decreasing the countries reliance on foreign oil can have national security benefits, but the disregard for climate change and its negative impacts on the US and its allies is concerning.
- **Global Isolation:** The order could further isolate the United States in terms of global environmental policy, damaging existing international alliances.

Final Summary: This Executive Order represents a significant shift in energy and environmental policy, favoring traditional energy sources and deregulation. While it aims to boost the economy and energy independence, it raises concerns about environmental protection, climate change mitigation, and the potential abuse of executive authority. It is anticipated to face legal challenges.
